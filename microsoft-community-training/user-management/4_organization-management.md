Microsoft Community Training supports multiple organizations to be created on the training platform where content and users can be mutually exclusive to each other. 

An **Organization** on the Microsoft Community Platform is a set of learners and administrators who have a particular purpose or belong to a specific criteria viz. location, job function, interest etc. The organization administrator can use the management portal to manage content and users for its organization. 

Global administrators can define the organizations on the training platform based on their specific training requirements. In this topic, you will learn simple steps to create and manage Organizations and Organization Administrators on the training portal.
