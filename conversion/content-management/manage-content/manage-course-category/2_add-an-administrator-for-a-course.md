# Add an administrator for a course

There are two types of content admin in the Microsoft Community Training  platform â€“ Category administrator and Course administrator. There is no limit to the number of Category administrator and Course administrator that you can create on the platform. 

1.	**Category administrator** is responsible for content creation and management of all the courses under one or more categories on the portal.

2.	**Course administrator** is responsible for content creation and management of one or more courses on the portal.

> [!TIP]
> You can add an user both a category administrator as well as a course administrator on the management portal. For example, an employee from the HR department will be responsible for creating and maintaining all the courses under the compliance category but the same employee may only be responsible for managing  soft skills related training courses under the career development category. In such scenarios, the employee will be added as category administrator for compliance category and course administrator for soft skills courses under career development category.
