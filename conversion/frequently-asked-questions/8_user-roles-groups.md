# User Roles & Groups

## Administrator roles and types

#### What administrative controls does Microsoft Community Training provide to the organization?
The platform follows a role-based administration hierarchy. There are four admin roles supported on the portal:

1. **Organization Administrator** - This role is assigned to decision makers or program owners who are responsible for the overall execution, monitoring and success of the training program.  The organization administrator can use the management portal to create content, manage users, enroll learners to courses, use reports & analytics, and customize the portal for branding purposes.

2. **Category Administrator** - Category administrators can create a new course and manage all the existing courses for a given category they are assigned as administrator. A user can be a category administrator for one or more categories on the management portal.

3. **Course Administrator** - Course administrators can manage and update content only for the courses they are assigned as administrator. A user can be a course administrator for one or more courses on the portal.

4. **Group Administrator** - This role is assigned by organization administrator to a grassroot-level facilitator, trainer, supervisor or manager who is responsible to drive learner engagement and adoption of the training program on the ground. The group administrator takes care of onboarding users, assigning courses and driving course completion via announcements/discussions forum.

For more information, please visit **[this article](../get-started/3_user-role-and-management-portal-overview)**.


#### How many administrators can the Microsoft Community Training portal have? 
There are no such limitations, the portal can have any number of administrators. Microsoft Community Training management portal provides four types of administrative roles to a user on the portal - Organization Administrator, Category Administrator, Course Administrator and Group Administrator. 

For more information, please visit **[this article](../get-started/3_user-role-and-management-portal-overview)**.


#### How can I add administrator to specific group and restrict access to any other groups and courses? 
Group administrators are allowed to manage users in the group, assign courses, and track their completion. By default, they don't have course management access. Refer this [**article**](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/add-an-administrtor-to-the-portal) for more information. 


#### How to switch between administrator and learner view?
Once you login to the portal, by default, you will be shown the learner view. Click the round user icon on the top right of the screen and choose the View as an administrator option from the drop-down menu to open the management portal.

For more information, [**refer here**](../get-started/4_step-by-step-configuration-guide#step-2--switch-to-administrator-view-of-the-portal).

#### Can a group administrator also be a learner on the platform?
Yes, group administrators can be enrolled to courses on the platform and consumed training content as a learner.

#### Can group admin and category admin be the same person?
Yes, the same person can be group admin and a category admin.

#### Can I assign administrators for a specific group or course?
Yes, you can assign administrators for specific groups or courses. 

For more details [**refer here**](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/add-an-administrtor-to-the-portal#add-a-group-administrator-to-the-portal).


#### Can a group have more than one administrator?
Yes, you can add any number of administrators to a group as required.


## Users registration & onboarding

#### What is the different status for users on the platform? Registered v/s unregistered users?
Every user added to the platform will be marked as either Registed or Unregistered as described below:

**Registered User** - Users whose  profile information data is fully complete are called registered users

**Unregistered User** - Users whose profile information data isn't fully complete are called unregistered users. This is typically th case when admins have bulk upload users on the platform but learners haven't actually logged into the platform yet.


#### How can I onboard users to the Microsoft Community Training platform? 
There are 3 ways to onboard users to Microsoft Community Training platform:

1. **Add a single user manually** - You can add users individually (one by one) on the management portal. Refer **[this article](../user-management/organize-users/3_add-a-single-user-to-the-group)** to learn how.

2.	**Add multiple users manually** - You can add multiple users at once by using the bulk upload feature via the CSV file. Refer **[this article](../user-management/organize-users/4_add-multiple-users-to-the-group)** to learn how.

3.	**Add users via API** - Microsoft Community Training platform provides APIs to push users to the platform from your existing system. To learn how to leverage APIs, refer **[this article](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/6_apis)**.


#### I have a list of users in an excel file. How can I add them to the portal?
You can import users using csv data to our platform. However, there are certain prerequisites involved. 

[**Refer here**](../user-management/organize-users/4_add-multiple-users-to-the-group) for the detailed steps. 


#### Will I be able to bulk import users from my existing database?

Yes, you can bulk import existing users to Microsoft community training using our REST APIs. 

#### Bulk upload users feature doesn't seem to be working?	
Bulk upload is a resource intensive operation and might take time until the process is completed. Please wait until the operation is complete. 

If you see errors while uploading users in bulk, it is possible that your CSV file is corrupt or has some errors. To make sure your file is correct, follow the instructions given **[here](../user-management/organize-users/4_add-multiple-users-to-the-group)**.



## Managing groups and users 

#### How can admin use groups on the Microsoft Community Training platform?
Groups are a way to help you organize your learners depending on the organization structure and the needs of your training program. Groups make user management easy via bulk user onboarding and automatic enrolment.

For example, let's say there is an organization in South Africa that has employees located across the country who are required to be trained and upskilled regularly.

* To effectively manage and train their geographically distributed workforce, an organization can decide to create a group based on their office locations such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, Port Elizbeth, etc.

* Another way to manage and organize the workforce would be based on the roles and departments such as Sales, Marketing, Human Resources, Operations, etc.

Organizations can use groups to manage different types of learners on the portal and automate user enrolment to the groups based on the skills required, user location, functional domains, role etc. For example, you can [**create groups**](../user-management/organize-users/2_create-a-new-group) and [**set rules to automatically add users**](../user-management/organize-users/5_setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1) to the group whenever they sign up on the platform.

Alternatively, the organization can also [**manually add users**](../user-management/organize-users/4_add-multiple-users-to-the-group) to the group at once.


#### How to create user groups and add users to a group? 
You can create user groups by login and switch to administrator view ➔ Select Users tab ➔ Click on New group on the bottom left of the page. 

For a detailed step by step guide on creating new user groups [**refer here**](../user-management/organize-users/2_create-a-new-group). 

Users can be added in groups by two ways:

1. [**Manually add users to a group**](../user-management/organize-users/2_create-a-new-group#manually-add-users-to-group-during-creation-time) – You will be able to upload single or bulk users.
2. [**Automatic user enrollment**](../user-management/organize-users/2_create-a-new-group#automatically-add-users-to-group-during-creation) – Automatic groups allow you to set specific rules which will auto add users to the group based on specified rules. 


#### How many users can be in a group?
Microsoft Community Training does not set any numeric limits on the number of people who can be in a group.


#### Can I auto-enroll users to groups based on their profile information? 
Microsoft Community Training platform  allows you to automatically add users to the specific group whenever the user's profile information matches the criteria of the rules.

When a user registers on the portal and completes the profile information, the values entered are compared against the rule applied by administrators for different groups and users are added to all the groups where criteria match.

You can [**refer here**](../user-management/organize-users/5_setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1) for the steps involved in setting up rule based groups.

#### How can I classify users into multiple groups based on Region, Country, Role or Department? 
You can setup rule based group to auto enroll users based on their role, department, geography etc. However, there is prerequisite in achieving this. 

You can [**refer here**](../user-management/organize-users/5_setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1) for the steps involved.

#### How are users initially invited to the platform to create an account? By an email link? 
You can invite users by sending mass emails, SMS, announcements on your existing website etc. along with the access links to the portal and mobile app.

#### Will my users be able to view or access the group that they are added to? 
Groups are accessible only to the administrators. Users will not be able to access or view any group-related information. 

Example: A user from the HR group will only be able to access and view courses assigned to him/her. Information such as group name, group administrator & list of users on the group is not displayed to the user.  

#### How can I export users registered on the platform?
You can export all the users registered on the platform from the administrator view

* Select Users from the left nav bar
* Select all users 
* Click on download users on the top right corner 

Refer the below image for clarity

#### How to send mass announcements to all the users of my platform?
In order to send mass announcements, all users on the platform must be added to a single group. Once the above condition is met you will be able to send announcements straight from the group. 

For more information on announcements [**refer here**](../user-management/manage-users/3_send-announcement-to-the-users).


## Course assignment and tracking


#### How can I assign courses only to a specific set of users?
You can assign courses to a specific set of users in two ways 

* **Adding users from Courses Tab**:  Organization administrators can manually add users to respective courses as required 

   ![image.png](../media/image%28311%29.png)

* **Assigning courses to a user group**: Group administrators can select the list of courses that should be available for users of a specific group. 

   ![image.png](../media/image%28312%29.png)

#### How skill matrix and competencies can be mapped to assign courses to the learners?
You can leverage auto enroll users to groups feature to  add and enroll users to specific group and courses as their interest and skills gaps. 

For Example: you can add **Skills Required** as one of the profile field in the platform and create rules to enroll users to specific groups with courses preassigned to auto enroll learners to required courses based on their interest areas, skill gaps identified, etc. 

For more information, refer to the following articles:
1. [**Create additional profile fields**](../settings/4_add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information) on the portal
2. [**Create a group**](../user-management/organize-users/2_create-a-new-group) and [**setup rule for auto enrollment**](../user-management/organize-users/5_setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1) 
3. [**Assign course to the group**](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/assign-course-to-group-users)

#### How can I remove or unregister user from a course?
Only organization administrators have the right to unregister or remove the user from a course. 

For detailed steps **[refer here](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/manage-user-enrollment-for-a-course)**.

#### How can I unassign courses to the learners in the platform?	
Courses can be unassigned to learners from Courses tab. To unassign courses for the learners in the platform, refer to [**this article**](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/manage-user-enrollment-for-a-course#remove-user-enrollment-for-a-course).

#### How can administrator access completion certificate of the learners on the portal?
There is no UI available for administrators to view and download learners certificates. Currently, only learners can view and download completion certificate on the platform.

However, administrators can contact Microsoft Community Training team via **[Helpdesk](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630)** for getting access to learners certificate. Our support team will reach out to you in 2-3 business days and help you with your requirements.
