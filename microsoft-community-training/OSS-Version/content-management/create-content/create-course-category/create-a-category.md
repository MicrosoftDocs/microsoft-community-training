# Create a category

A **category** is a collection of courses on a specific topic. Categories help you organize your learning content for different learners. You can create a new category and add courses with lessons, practice quizzes and exams.
In this article, you will learn more about how to create a category, edit a category and delete a category in respective sections.

## Permissions Level

The Microsoft Community Training management portal provides role-based administration and depending upon the type of access level admins can perform an action on the portal. Table below shows the administrative roles which are allowed to create, edit or delete category:

| Access Level  | Create Category |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | Yes |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | Yes |
| Group Administrator | No |

    > Recommended size for the thumbnail image is 320*180 px

6. Select the **Organization** for the category. By default, it is assigned to a default organization.

    > [!Note]
    > If your instance is Multi-Tenant enabled, refer [Enabling Global Content across organizations](../../content-management-overview.md#enabling-global-content-across-organizations), to have a common content enabled for organizations

7. Click or tap on the **Create** button to create a new category.

8. Once the category is created, you will see this window to choose from options to create course.

    * You can choose [**Add new course**](create-a-new-course.md#option-1---create-a-single-course-in-a-category) under the category and upload content for the learning program.
    * You can [**Bulk Upload**](create-a-new-course.md#option-3---create-multiple-courses-in-a-category) under the category and upload multiple courses at once to save time.
    * You can choose to import courses via [**Marketplace**](create-a-new-course.md#option-2---add-course-via-content-marketplace) which contains catalogue of expert curated courses to get a head start on your training program.

### Adding translations for your Category name

If you have [multiple languages](../../../settings/customize-languages-for-the-learners-on-the-platform.md#customize-languages-on-the-platform) enabled for your instance, then you can add translations for your Category fields.

1. While creating a [new category](#create-a-category) you can select the language from dropdown to add translations.

2. Now based on language selection in learner view the category name would be translated.
