# Delete a user from the group

Deleting or removing a user from a group will only remove the user from the selected group. It will not impact user participation in other groups nor remove any course that was already assigned to the user before being a part of this group.

If the administrator removes a learner from a specific group, all links between the learner and the course through that group will be lost and the user will be de-assigned from those courses unless another link still exists through another group. For more information refer [here](De-assigning-content-from-user.md).

In this topic, you will learn how to remove an existing user from a group.
