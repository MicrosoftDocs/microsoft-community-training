Currently, Microsoft Community Training supports SSO out of box for scenarios where users are managed via Azure AD or customers are using Azure AD B2C for authentication in their existing system.

However, the platform supports SSO with any OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect or SAML based authentication provider. To enable SSO in such scenarios, please contact us via **[Helpdesk](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630)** and leave your requirements in the ticket description.

Microsoft Community Training platform provides REST APIs to help organization build custom experience, integrate the platform with their existing system or consume training content via custom endpoints.

For e.g. Organization can use Microsoft Flow, Logic Apps, etc. to integrate the platform with their HRMS and CRM systems to import/sync users to the platform or export course progress and completion status.

We are building up a community of learning partners who can assist the organizations in implementing and configuring the platform for their training scenarios.

#### What should I do if I no longer need the platform? How can I download the training content and data before terminating?
Since there is no licensing fee and customers are only paying for the Azure consumptions, you just need to go ahead and delete the resource group where the platform is deployed.  

Before delete the resource group, we recommend you to create a copy of content and user data from the azure portal.
