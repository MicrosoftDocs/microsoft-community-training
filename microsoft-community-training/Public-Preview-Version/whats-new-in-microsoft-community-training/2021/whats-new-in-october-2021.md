# Whatâ€™s new in October 2021

As the world moves towards the last quarter of the year 2021, the fight against the pandemic has gained momentum with vaccination drives being conducted around the world. Following same spirit, Microsoft Community Training Team has worked its way through this phase to make the platform a better place to manage and learn.

We are really excited to share the new product update of Microsoft Community Training with you! Following are some key features introduced in this release that are designed to help you continue manage and deliver online learning in a seamless manner to your community.

## Multiple authentication modes in a single instance

Many organizations might want to support multiple authentication options to be available for their learners. The platform now supports adding more than one Authentication option for a single MCT instance.

For instance, you can now enable MCT phone authentication along side your existing social login on ADB2C tenant. Users can choose to register and login either via phone or their social email.

## Blended learning with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Community Training platform allows the Administrators to set-up and schedule meetings with Microsoft Teams from within the platform itself without needing to switch between platforms. Administrators can create meetings for groups of learners enrolled to a specific course or learning path or user group to enhance the learning curve.

In this release, the platform is launching [support for progressive web applications](../../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md#option-1-creating-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-for-android) (PWA), to make the web application installable as mobile application for hosting on application stores. In this release, the PWA based application will be available only for android eco-system and will not support content download for consumption in no-connectivity mode. In the next release, planned for December 2021 the progressive web application support will be extended to iOS eco-system and content download. The platform will then plan to deprecate the current process of generating mobile application AAB files via support tickets.
