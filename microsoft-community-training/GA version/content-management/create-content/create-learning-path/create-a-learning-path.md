# Create a Learning path

A **Learning Path** is a defined sequence of courses providing guided training paths to the learners and the ability for instructors to control the way these courses are assigned to them, offering a clear-cut road-map to what they should achieve.

A Learning Path references courses from different Categories on the training platform which learners can be guided to complete in an specified order. A Learning Path can be assigned by the administrators to a individual or a group of users.

In this article, you will learn how to create Learning Path(s) on the Community Training platform.

## Permissions Level

The Community Training portal provides role-based permission levels. The table below shows which administrative roles are allowed to create Learning Paths on the portal:

| Access Level  | Create Learning Path |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | Yes |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | No |
| Group Administrator | No |

1. Select the **Organization** for the Learning Path to assign to a different organization from the default.

    > [!Note]  
    > If your instance is Multi-Tenant enabled, refer [Enabling Global Content across organizations](../../content-management-overview.md#enabling-global-content-across-organizations), to have common Learning paths enabled across organizations.
