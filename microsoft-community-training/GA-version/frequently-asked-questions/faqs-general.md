### Who is the target audience for Community Training?

Community Training is built and optimized for large-scale community skilling programs, specially for the not for profit organizations, PubSec, such as volunteers, program beneficiaries, etc. The platform is designed for mobile-first and mobile-only audiences and supports learning even on low-bandwidth networks and low-end smartphones.

The platform is already being used by a number of educational institutions, governmental organizations, and nonprofits.

### What kind of training scenarios I can use Community Training for?

Community Training can be leveraged in a wide range of training use cases such as Mobile workforce training, Partner Training, Customer Training, Community Training, Online Learning Academy, and many others.

These training use cases cut across multiple verticals such as Non Profits,Government,Retail, Healthcare, Education Organizations.

Community Training enables organizations to not only share content with the target audience but also allows them to assess and track learner’s progress via non-graded assessments, graded assessments, and real-time analytics.

For more information [**visit the website**.](https://communitytraining.microsoft.com/).

### Can I use  Community Training to train my partners on Microsoft Products and Technologies?

Organizations can use Community Training to host and train their workforces on multiple topics including Microsoft Products & Services. The platform comes with readily available content around Digital Literacy, Office 365, Azure, and more.

 Also, you can host content from [**Microsoft Learn training**](/training/) into the platform to provide a one-stop shop for all training courses to your target audience.

For more details on how to leverage the import of this content on your platform instance, reach out to us [**via HelpDesk**](https://aka.ms/cthelpdesk).

### How to create/add a new course on Community Training

Courses can be created from the administrator dashboard, for the detailed steps on course creation [refer to this article.](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md)

### I already have a Learning Management System (LMS) implemented for my organization. Will Community Training replace my existing LMS or is it going to complement my existing system?

Traditionally LMS software is focused on knowledge workers and workforces managed by the organization. But every organization often has a huge number of frontline workers (contractors, vendors, external staff, etc.) or extended partner networks (distributors, suppliers, retailers, etc.) who are not managed by the organization, which means there is no organization email address provided. These audiences are typically mobile-first users with low technology capability and usually require an online learning solution that is designed and optimized for shared low-bandwidth mobile device usage.

Community Training supports personalized learning for large-scale mobile-based workforces and communities. It is affordable, easy to manage, and provides robust security and privacy protection. Organizations can leverage Community Training to:

* Manage courses, users, and analytics all in one place with the management portal.
* Empower managers, trainers, and facilitators on the ground to easily reach out to the far-spread training audience and drive adoption of the learning program.
* Customize the look and feel of the platform and select learner endpoints for content consumption as per your organization's needs
* Track learning progress and measure outcomes using rich out-of-box reports or create custom dashboards to monitor health and measure overall program success.
* Leverage APIs to create your own training experience or integrate it into your existing systems.

So, depending on the use cases, organizations can use Community Training in either of the following ways:

* **If an organization already has an LMS in place** – Organizations can use this platform for unmanaged audiences like first-line workers, extended workforces, partner ecosystem, volunteer networks, program beneficiaries, etc. who need to access content via mobile number or personal email address.

* **If an organization has no LMS** - Organizations can use this platform for both internal as well as external audiences.

### How many organizations are already using Community Training?

Currently, Community Training is being used by hundreds of customers across India, Africa, South East Asia, and Latin America to enable skilling their workforces or training communities at scale.  For example here are some press releases on the partnership with existing customers: [**African Development Bank**](https://news.microsoft.com/en-xm/2019/12/10/african-development-bank-launches-digital-tool-to-help-african-youth-learn-to-code/), [**Digital Nigeria**](https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/press-releases/nigeria-african-development-bank-partners-government-and-microsoft-launch-digital-nigeria-elearning-platform-38060), [**UNICEF**](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-and-microsoft-launch-global-learning-platform-help-address-covid-19-education) ,[**Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs - Govt. of India**](https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-project-sangam-swacch-bharat-mission/).

After the session, to mark the course completion, you can give learners assessements that they can attempt to validate their training progress and achieve a certificate.
