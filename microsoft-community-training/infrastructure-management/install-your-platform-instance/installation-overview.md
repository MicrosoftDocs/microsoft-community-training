# Installation Overview

The **Community Training** platform is available as an offering on the Azure portal. If you’re new to Azure, learn more about it [**here**](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-azure/).

Community Training is available with multiple endpoints for the learners. For example: a standalone white-labelled web application; an Android mobile app; within Microsoft Teams; or via API integration into your own custom app (Coming Soon).

Learners can login to any of these endpoints in three different ways: Phone number (Via ADB2C), Social Account (Microsoft/Facebook/Google) and Work or School Account (Azure Active Directory).

Once you install Community Training in your subscription, you don't have to maintain, update, or service it. All updates to the application will be delivered automatically by Microsoft without the need for you to worry about troubleshooting and diagnosing issues.

You have full access to the **Application resource group**. You can use it to manage the lifecycle of your instance, which includes restarting it or deleting it.

The **Managed resource group** holds all the resources that are required by Community Training, such as Azure App Service, Azure Storage, Azure Media Service. You have limited access to this resource group as Microsoft will manage all the individual resources for your instance on your behalf.

For more details, please refer to [**Azure managed applications**](/azure/managed-applications/overview) documentation.
