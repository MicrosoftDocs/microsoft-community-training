# What's new in April 2020

We’re excited to share the new product updates for Community Training with you! These updates will go live on your training platform instance by the end of the week. There are some useful features in this release designed to help you manage and seamlessly deliver online learning to your communities.

## Enforce learners to navigate lessons in a course sequentially

By default, learners can jump to any lesson or practice quiz throughout a course freely. But there are often times when you may need learners to go through the course items in a particular sequence. In this update, we have released a new setting that allows you to restrict lesson ordering when creating or editing a course. This ensures that Learners can only consume lessons in sequence. Skipping will not be permitted. For more details, [**check this article**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md).

## Support for multiple selection field for learner profile information

Organization Administrator can now [**create additional profile fields**](../../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md) to allow learners to select 1 or more relevant options from the dropdown list during profile creation. This type of profile fields are useful to capture learner information such as Topics of Interest, Learning Preferences, etc. which can be later used by administrators to create groups and auto-assign courses.

## Support for rich text and images in the assessment module

With the new release, we have enhanced our assessment module to allow content administrators to add rich text and images for questions in the Practice Quiz and Exams for a course. This enables content administrators to create a variety of question types such as Multiple Choice, Fill-in-the-blank, Image-based questions/answers, Chronological Questions, etc. on the platform. For more details, check out [**this article**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-assessments-to-a-course.md#question-types-for-any-assessment).

## Upload HTML content for lessons in a course

Content admins can now add interactive content in HTML format as lessons to a course. The HTML content can be consumed by the learners both on the web and mobile app (even in offline mode). With this new improvement similar to other content types like PDF, video, etc., you can [**upload and manage HTML**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md) files as a lesson in a course.

## Embed any external web link as lesson content for a course

In this release, we have made improvements to the Course Management module to allow content admins to embed any external web content link as a lesson item for a course. Now, depending upon the link type, content will be shown inline or learners will be redirected to the external platform for consumption. This improvement is particularly useful for aggregating content from external sources such as [Microsoft Learn training](/training/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/watch), etc., and provides a centralized repository of learning material within Community Training  for your target audience.
