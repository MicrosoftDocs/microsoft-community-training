# Add learners to the platform

The Community Training platform provides two ways to add learners to the portal: Administrators can add learners through a specific group or directly through the **All Users** list. The **All Users** option is available only to Global Administrators.
  
## Option 1 – Add a Learner via All users

In this topic, you will learn how to add a learner from the All Users list.
  
### Permissions Level

The Community Training management portal provides role-based permission levels. The table below shows which administrative roles can add learners from All Users list:

| Access Level | Add learners via All Users |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | No |
| Learning Path Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | No |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Group Administrator | No |

### Steps to add learners via All Users list

1. Log on to the Community Training portal and [**switch to administrator view**](../../get-started/step-by-step-configuration-guide.md#step-2--switch-to-administrator-view-of-the-portal).

1. Select **All Users** in the left-navigation page from the users module.

1. Select **Add Users** from the top-right of the details page.

1. Choose between the following two methods to add users:

    - **Add Single User** – Use this option to add one user at a time. Select **Add Single user**, enter the phone number then select **Add** to confirm.

    - **Bulk upload users** – This option is used to add multiple users in one action. For detailed steps, see how to [**structure the csv file and bulk upload users**](../organize-users/add-multiple-users-to-the-group.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If the platform is setup with the login identity **Social Account** or **Azure Active Directory** then you will need to enter an email address in the above step.

## Option 2 – Add Learner via Groups

> [!Note]  
> When the same user is added to multiple groups, it won't create a duplicate user i.e. there is only 1 user on the platform against one email address or phone number.

In this topic, you will learn how to add a learner via specific group.
