# Community Training Phone based Identity Migration

The Microsoft’s Community Training, in its efforts to provide a better service and security on its platform, is ending the support for the Phone based identity Authentication service by 30th April 2025 and is providing [the Azure ADB2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/) service as its alternative.

# What is Azure ADB2C:

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution that enables you to sign up and sign in your customers into your apps and APIs. Your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications. Learn more about ADB2C [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview).

The process for setting up ADB2C on Community Training is detailed in this [document](../Phone_Auth_Migration_Files/ADB2C.md).

# Identity Options

ADB2C provides following identity options

1.  **Migrate to an ADB2C provided phone Identity**:

# Migration Process

The Migration process involves the following steps:

1.  Customer will setup the ADB2C on their subscription based on identity options selected.
2.  Customer will inform the Community Trainingteam via [**helpdesk**](https://aka.ms/cthelpdesk) once ADB2C set up is complete.
3.  Community Training Team will implement the necessary steps to enable migration to new identity and retaining their progress.

The Migration can happen in either of the two ways:

1.  Administrator driven Migration.
2.  Learner driven Migration.

## Administrator driven Migration

This is for scenarios where your administrator already knows the mapping between existing mobile number and new identity (username/email for the learners.
 
>[!NOTE]  
> In this case, you will have to communicate the new identity (for eg: username) to the respective learners who can login by resetting their passwords.

### Migration Steps:

1.  Administrator logs in to the Community Training portal using the new ADB2C Global Admin login credentials (eg: Username/email) and navigates to Admin view

    Follow the steps Under “Migration into Microsoft’s ADB2C Identity“ in “Settings” tab. The status of the migration and the errors (If any) will be shown in the notifications.

A template file is provided on the UI. It can also be downloaded from here: [template File](../../media/Phone_Auth_Migration_Files/IdentityMigration.csv)

>[!Note]  
> Please ensure that there are no duplicates in the mappings file – i.e. one mobile number should be mapped to only one email/username.* An incorrect mapping may result in the historical learner progress and certificates being mapped to a different learner.

>[!Note]
> Please Ensure that the required data is only in three columns. i.e., Country Code, Phone Number and the new identity. Plese delete data in other columns. 

2. The status of migration can be seen in the notifications.

## Learner driven Migration

This is for scenarios where you would like the learners to migrate their identities using a simple UI navigation that is presented to them upon login.

> [!Note]  
> Based on the login type you select; the learner may have to sign themselves up or reset their password.

### Migration Steps:

1.  The learner will sign in/sign up in Community Training portal. They will see a message on the sign in page.   


![Sign in page message](Migration_Screenshots/Learner_Driven_Migration/Mobile_Landing_Page.png)


2.  Existing learners, will be presented with a screen to input their mobile number that was used previously to login to the platform. On successful confirmation of the mobile number, the learner will be sent an OTP (One Time Password) for validation.

> [!Note]  
> New users should skip this step to provide mobile number and proceed to learner’s home page in portal.  

3.  Post validation, the learner progress will be migrated to the new identity in 30 minutes.
