# Detailed step by step installation guide

In this article, you’ll learn how to install and deploy the Community Training platform on your Azure subscription.

## Before you begin

### 1. Create a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription

Create a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. To learn more about how to create it, refer [**this article**](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) on Azure documentation.

If you have a free trial Azure subscription, please upgrade to a Pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. See the [**detailed steps here**](/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription#upgrade-your-azure-free-account). **We currently do not support Microsoft Community Training on free trial Azure subscriptions.**

> [!WARNING]
> If you’re a nonprofit organization who wants to use Microsoft Community Training platform, you can apply and avail the Azure grant subject to eligibility. See the [**detailed steps here**](../../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/setup-platform-instance-on-azure-subscription-for-nonprofits.md).

### 2. Get the right ownership access

Get the **owner** access to your pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. To learn more about how to get access, refer [**this article**](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on Azure documentation.

You will require **Owner** or **Contributor** role on the subscription to go through these steps.  

 Along with these,you will need to have:

* **"Application Administrator" + "External ID User Flow Administrator" OR "Global Administrator" access - for Azure AD B2C**
* **"Application Administrator" OR "Global Administrator" - for Microsoft Entra ID**
