#### We run programs for different centers in various locations, and often need a different front end to match the branding of the specific program. Is this possible?

Microsoft Community Training doesn't support multiple homepages out of the box. However, you can customize and develop multiple standalone HTML pages (one for each program) with a link to login to the Learner view. Course assignment can be controlled by prompting the user to choose the employment center / program during the one-time sign up process.

You can customize the landing page with a custom theme color, banner image and welcome text. Refer [**this article**](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/configure-the-look-and-feel-of-your-portal) to learn more.

Alternatively, you can create your own landing page and direct users to the training instance from the landing page.

#### Is it possible to hide courses shown on the home page when web portal is opened?
Yes, it is possible and  can be achieved in two ways.

* **Method 1** : All the courses enrollment on the portal must be set to “Only admins can enroll users”. This way courses that are set to admin only will not be displayed on the home page.

* **Method 2** : You can have your own custom homepage and simply set redirection triggers to the sign-in page, which allows the customers to bypass our default homepage.

#### Can I customize the profile information I want to capture for each learner? 
By default, learners will be asked for their first name, last name, and profile photo on sign up. As an organization, you can capture additional information at the time of login and display privacy terms and conditions for the learners.
