# Learner Action Events Infrastructure

Community Training enables events infrastructure via the Azure Service Bus to enable you to track dynamic learner actions on the training platform. The events allow you to build accurate learner action journeys on the platform.

## Azure Service Bus Setup

### What is Azure Service Bus?

Azure Service Bus is a cloud messaging as a service which enables you to subscribe and capture the learner action events raised by the Community Training platform. To read more about the Azure Service Bus infrastructure, check [this document](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/).

### Steps to add Azure Service Bus to your Subscription

1. Create a Service Bus Instance from Azure Portal following [this documentation](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal), with Topic Name : CTEvents

2. Once the Topic is created, go to the topic -> Subscriptions (Under Entities on left panel) and click on **+ Subscription**
    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Service Bus - Add Subscription.PNG" alt-text="Add subscription":::

3. Add the details in the **Create Subscription** page as per your requirement.

4. Go to the same **Service Bus** instance, and click on **Access Control (IAM)** from the left pane and go to **Role assignments**.
    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Service Bus - Access Control.PNG" alt-text="Access Control":::

5. Assign the user (for running locally), AppService (for running in App service) Azure Service Bus Data Owner role in "Access control (IAM) -> Role assignments" tab of the service bus instance; here is a [Reference Document](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity#to-assign-azure-roles-using-the-azure-portal).

6. Go to the **Overview** section of the same **Service Bus** instance and copy the **Host name**.
:::image type="content" source="../../media/Service Bus - Host Name.PNG" alt-text="Get Host Name":::

7. Go to your App Service for which events infrastructure has to be configured and follow the steps on [this document](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md#steps-to-set-the-configurations-on-the-platform) to add application settings.

8. Add the following application setting:
    - **Name:** *ServiceBusNamespaceFQDN*
    - **Value:** Value of the Host Name as copied from Step 6
:::image type="content" source="../../media/Service Bus - App setting1.PNG" alt-text="App Setting 1":::

9. You may also add the following application settings basis your requirement:
    1. **Features:Events:Login** : Application Settings for subscribing to login event
    2. **Features:Events:CourseStart** : Application Settings for subscribing to course start event
    3. **Features:Events:ModuleCompletion** : Application Settings for subscribing to module completion event
    4. **Features:Events:CourseCompletion** : Application Settings for subscribing to course completion event

    The **Value** to these would be ***True*** if you want these events to be logged in and tracked.

    For more information on the above app settings, please refer to the details below under the topic **Events Infrastructure**.

10. Click on save.

### Sample code to consume CT Events

[Refer this document](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions) to access sample code for setting Azure Service Bus Integration to consume the events raised by the Community Training platform.

[Refer this document](/azure/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service) to implement Azure Service Bus using private link.

#### Sample event from CT

```
Course Completion Event
{
"EventType": "COURSE_COMPLETION",
"MessageBody": {
"FirstName" : String, // First Name of the user
"LastName" : String, // Last Name of the user
"UserId" : Integer, // UserId of the user
"Contact" : String, // Contact of the user
"ContactType" : String, //"Email" or "Phone" or "AzureAD"
"CourseName" : String, // Name of the course
"CourseId" : Integer, // Id of the course
"CompletionDate": String, // Course completion date
"ExamPercentage": String, // Exam percentage, "Not Applicable" if no exam present.
}
```

## Events Infrastructure

### Events Enabled

Community Training has enabled 4 types of events for customers to track dynamic learner actions on their training instance,  

1. **Login Event**: This will be called when the user explicitly signs in by clicking the Sign In URL in CT during On-boarding or the AD B2C token of the learner is expired (generally every 90 days) when accessing via the Driverâ€™s app.
2. **Course Start Event**: This will be called when a learner starts a course, this is same as lesson starting since Grab only has 1 video lesson in the system (at least with the current migration)
3. **Module Completion**: This will be the completion of either the lesson or the exam in the course
4. **Course Completion**: This will be the Course Completion event sent once the Exam is passed

### Sample Sequence of Events

Following will be the sequence of event for a learner accessing a course in CT with 1 video and 1 lesson.

1. LOGIN: When the learner clicks on Sign In button in CT explicitly
2. COURSE_START: Start of the Course which is equivalent to start of the Lesson or the Exam
3. MODULE_COMPLETION: End of Video Completion
4. MODULE_COMPLETION: Exam completed
5. COURSE_COMPLETION: Course completed
6. COURSE_START: UI re-rendering post exam completion
7. COURSE_START: UI re-rendering post course completion
