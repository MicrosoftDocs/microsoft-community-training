# Course View

Similar to the Category View, Course View provides admins a quick glance at learner enrollments, learner engagement, and course completion for a particular course. It facilitates comparative analytics for learner performance on a particular course and provides insights into content quality.

To access the Course View, you can either select a specific row from the courses grid in the Category View page.

In this article, you will learn more about different metrics and reports available to the administrator as part of learner analytics for a specific course:

## Permissions Level

The Community Training portal provides role-based administration and depending on the access level,  administrators can perform certain actions on the portal.  The table below shows the administrative roles which can access the Course View:  

|Access Level|  Course View|

### Learners enrollment over time

The graph provides information about all the unique learners enrolled for a specific course over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph.

The values that are measured are:

* y-axis — Number of unique learners registered for a particular course

As shown in the image below, there are 34 unique learners enrolled on the portal for the course.

### Course enrollment/completion over time

The graph provides information about total course enrollment and course completion across all the courses under a given category over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph. The values that are measured are:

* x-axis — Timeline
* y-axis — Total no. of course enrollments/completion across for a particular course

As shown in the image below, there is 1 unique user who has completed the course on the portal.

This view gives a graphical representation of the growth in the number of course enrollments and course completions for all courses for a given category over a period. The data presented can help take corrective measures if the course completion curve falls below the course enrolment curve by a wide margin.

## Learner Performance

This section in the Course View enables an admin to track the learner’s progress and compare performance for a given course. In the table below, for each learner, you can see the completion percentage, number of lessons completed, number of quizzes completed (including exams), and average quiz score percentage (including exams).
