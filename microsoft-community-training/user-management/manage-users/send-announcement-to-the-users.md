# Send announcement to the users

The Community Training platform allows administrators to send customized messages and alerts or to broadcast information to different groups of users via the announcement feature. Users can view the information and updates sent by the administrators under the **Notice Board section** of the learner experience.

For example, if there are any courses that administrators would like to remind or encourage the learners to complete sooner, the administrator can send a customized message (such as ‘You still have not completed the compliance training. Please complete soon to get certified.’) as a follow up reminder to the group users and push for course completion.

In this article, you will learn how to send an announcement to the group of users from the management portal.
