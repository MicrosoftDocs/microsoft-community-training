# Create and Publish your Mobile App

In this article, we will learn about how to create and publish the Mobile App (available only for Android platform) for your training portal.  

![Create and Publish your Mobile App](../../media/image%2877%29.png)

For setting up the mobile app for your training portal, you will need a mobile app APK/AAB file and setup your Google PlayStore account. The APK/AAB file can be generated in two ways,

1. [Creating a progressive web application (PWA) for android](#option-1-creating-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-for-android)

2. [Requesting a mobile app AAB from the platform team](#option-2-requesting-a-mobile-app-aab-from-the-platform-team)

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft Community Training team will soon be deprecating the process of requesting mobile application from the platform and support only progressive web applications (PWA) for both android and iOS.

## Steps to create Mobile Application

## Option 1: Creating a progressive web application (PWA) for android

### What are Progressive Web Applications?

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Progressive) (PWAs) provide access to open web technologies for cross-platform interoperability and provide your users with an app-like experience customized for their devices.

PWAs are websites that are [progressively enhanced](https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement) to function like installed apps on supporting platforms, and like regular web sites on other browsers.

The qualities of a PWA combine the best of the web and compiled apps. PWAs run in browsers, like websites, but have access to app features like the ability to work offline, be installed on the operating system, support push notifications and periodic updates, access hardware features, and more.

When installed, PWAs are just like other apps on Windows or Android. They can be added to the Start Menu, pinned to the Taskbar, handle files, run on user login on Desktop and in Android PWA will added as native application in app tray.

Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage/website known as a web application, they do not require separate bundling or distribution. By following simple [**Installation Requirements**](#installation-requirements-for-pwa-mobile-application) as mentioned below, administrators can enable PWA to be available for learners to install on their devices. With [**PWA Builder**](#generate-android-app-bundle-using-pwa-builder), you can then build android app for you PWA enabled instance.

### Installation Requirements for PWA mobile application

#### Step 1: Update the configuration on the platform

1. Login to [**Azure portal**](https://www.portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to [**Application Settings**](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md#steps-to-set-the-configurations-on-the-platform) from your instance's app service.

3. Under Application settings tab, filter for **Features:EnableWebAppInstall** and set the Value as ‘**true**’
    * If this setting was not found then click on ‘New application setting’, provide **Features:EnableWebAppInstall** under Name and Value as ‘**true**’ as shown below.

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWAAppsetting.png" alt-text="App setting_PWA":::
    * Click OK and then Save the changes.

#### Step 2: Update Settings in Admin View for Mobile Application

1. Login to your Microsoft Community Training portal and [**switch to administrator view**](../../get-started/step-by-step-configuration-guide.md#step-2--switch-to-administrator-view-of-the-portal)

2. Click on **Settings** option from the left navigation panel and navigate to **Mobile Application** section.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/MobApplication_setting.png" alt-text="Mobile app settings":::

3. Under Mobile Application setting you need to specify following information:

    | Setting | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Mobile Application Name | You can specify your Instance name, this name will be used for rendering splash screen (Android), Start menu item (Windows) |
    | Mobile Application Short Name | This will be used to generate the App icon name on the device app tray. You can mention a shorter acronym of your instance name. |
    | Application Background Color | This setting will be used for rendering Splash screen (Android) |
    | Application Logo (512 px by 512 px) | The logo must be 512x512 pixels, MCT uses this image to render Splash screen, Start menu, App Launcher item for your PWA.  |

### Installing PWA on your Desktop and Mobile Device

1. Once the [Installation Requirements](#installation-requirements-for-pwa-mobile-application) for PWA are satisfied, as you login to your MCT instance you will be seeing an icon on the search bar of your browser indicating PWA app is available for installation.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/InstallPWA.png" alt-text="installPWAforwebapp":::

2. Users can now install the PWA which renders your MCT webapp as a native application.

3. After successful installation, you can check options to allow the app to pin to taskbar, pin to start, create a Desktop shortcut as per your requirement.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_installoptions.png" alt-text="installoptionspwa":::

4. For mobile devices (Android), users can install PWA by clicking on the prompt (add to home screen banner) that they receive while browsing your MCT instance or clicking on ‘install app’ from browser options.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Screenshot_20210930-161736_Chrome (3).jpg" alt-text="installpwaonphone":::

> [!Note]
> **Devices & Browser Compatibility:**
>
> * The PWA flow works as expected when using chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome.
>
> * For Firefox browser in desktop, the PWA install icon will not be seen on the URL bar, however the [service workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers) will be installed. In Mobile Firefox browser, you will have Add to home screen option that can install PWA.
>
> * Safari on iOS doesn’t support add to home screen banner, however the option is visible in the browser menu. You might notice some inconsistencies with PWA on iOS.

### Generate Android App Bundle using PWA Builder

As you enabled the PWA, in the backend there will be a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers) and a [web manifest](https://web.dev/add-manifest/) added, through which you can build a native Android application that can be bundled to be uploaded to your play store. We recommend using [**PWABuilder**](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) an online GUI tool that can generate APK & AAB files for your instance.

#### Prerequisites

Raise a [**ticket**](https://sangamhelpdesk.microsoftcrmportals.com/SignIn?ReturnUrl=%2Fsupport%2Fcreate-case%2F) with MCT support team requesting KeyStore file **in case you wanted to have an update for your existing mobile application.**

#### Part 1: Steps to Generate Android App Bundle

1. Open [**PWABuilder**](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)

2. In the text box on homepage of PWA builder, enter your instance URL (eg: contosolearning.azurewebsites.net) and click ‘Start’. In the backend PWABuilder will verify if you have a service worker and manifest available for your PWA.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_android.png" alt-text="PWAAndroidinsert":::

3. Click Next on the PWA’s report card page, score 130 and above suggests that you have met requirements by PWABuilder.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_android2.png" alt-text="PWAScore":::

4. You will be redirected to page where you can generate Android App bundle, to the right in Android section, click on "Store package".

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_android3.png" alt-text="PWABuildpackage":::

5. In 'Android App Options' window:

    1. If you want to update an existing application then mention [**Package ID**](https://developers.google.com/android/management/apps#install_apps) of your previously published android app.

    2. If creating application for first time, you can choose to leave it with pre-populated ID.

    3. Provide App name and Launcher name for your application. **If creating application for the first time, then you can proceeed to Step 6 generating your app bundle**

    4. Click on “All Settings” and increment your App version and App Version Code by 1 from the version of your existing app, if creating the app for first time do not increment the value.

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_migration.png" alt-text="pwamigration1":::

    5. Scroll to “Signing Key”, choose ‘Use Mine’ and upload the key store file that you received from MCT support team.

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_Existingapp.png" alt-text="PWA exixting app":::

    6. Download your application bundle.

6. Finish the process by running a script with steps as mentioned in this [document](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-community-training/files/8222196/PWA.Migration.docx) that will allow you for [Digital Asset linking](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started).

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. **Difference between installing PWA from browser and installing from Play Store?**
>    * There will be no difference in learning experience. However, with Play Store you can have access to analytics and ability to choose who can download the application. As Play Store certifies the application, it is more secure.
>
> 2. **Advantages of PWA over Native application**
>    * PWAs are light weight applications when compared to Native applications, therefore they occupy less space (typically less than 10 MB).
>
>    * Easy to maintain, as PWA is essentially a browser page running as Native application it would be at-par with updates released for web application.
>
>    * Any updates sent to web application would be automatically synced with your PWA.
> 3. **Things to remember when migrating from Native application to PWA**
>    * If you have updated your native application in Play Store with PWA then app gets automatically updated to user based on their device settings, else user needs to manually update the application from Play Store.
>
>    * Downloaded content will not be migrated from Native to PWA application. Learner needs to download the content again for offline consumption.

5. If you are creating an Android App for your instance for the first time (if you have an existing app and wanted it updated instead of creating new application, then proceed to step 6)

    * Provide App name and Launcher name for your application and click Generate.

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_android4.png" alt-text="PWAnewgenerate":::

6. If you have an existing android application published to play store and need to update it:

    * Log a [**help desk**](https://sangamhelpdesk.microsoftcrmportals.com/SignIn?ReturnUrl=%2Fsupport%2Fcreate-case%2F) ticket requesting a key store file for your previous android application.
    * In the “Google Play store Options” mention [**Package ID**](https://developers.google.com/android/management/apps#install_apps) of your previously published android application.
    * Click on “All Settings” and increment your App version and App Version Code by 1 from your existing app version.
    * Scroll to “Signing Key”, choose ‘Use Mine’ and upload the key store file that you received from MCT support team.

        :::image type="content" source="../../media/PWA_Existingapp.png" alt-text="PWA exixting app":::

7. Download your Application Bundle.

#### Part 2: Digital Asset Linking

Through Digital Asset Linking a website can declare that it is associated with a specific Android app, or it can declare that it wants to share user credentials with another website.

This links protocol & API and enable an app or website to make public, verifiable statements about other apps or websites. [**Learn More about Digital Asset Linking**](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started)

##### Steps to Digital Asset Linking

1. Navigate to `<your-website-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`
(If your instance url is contosolearning.azurewebsites.net then ‘contosolearning’ is your website name) and enter credentials which you used for azure portal when deploying MCT.

2. From Navigation bar on top, click on 'DebugConsole' and from dropdown click 'CMD'.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Digitalassetlinkscmd.png" alt-text="DALCMD":::

3. From the table of contents, navigate to `site/wwwroot/.well-known`
(create folder “.well-known” if it is not present )

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Digitalassetlinkssite.png" alt-text="DLASite":::

4. Drag and drop the `assetlinks.json` file (present in app bundle that you downloaded from PWAbuilder) in `site/wwwroot/.well-known` path.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Digitalassetlinksfinal.png" alt-text="DLAFinal":::

5. you can now [upload](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152?hl=en&ref_topic=7072031&visit_id=637708323322373803-2268564924&rd=1) your AAB to your Play Store.
