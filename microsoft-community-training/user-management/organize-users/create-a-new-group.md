# Create new group

Group is a key feature in the Microsoft Community Training platform. It enables you to delegate user management and drive learner engagement to the grassroots-level.

Groups make user management easy via automatic enrollment, bulk user onboarding, course assignments, announcements and monitoring learner progress.

> [!NOTE]
> In case of platform is setup with **Azure AD as login identity and Microsoft Teams as an end point**, you won't be allowed to create groups from the management portal. All the user management activities have to be performed inside Microsoft Teams)

In this article, you will learn more about how to create a new group on the management portal:

| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator  | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | No |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Group Administrator | Yes |
