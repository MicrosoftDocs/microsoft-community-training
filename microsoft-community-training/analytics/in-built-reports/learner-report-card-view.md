# Learner Report Card View

Learner Report Card View allows administrators to monitor and track each   learner’s progress and performance across all the enrolled courses. This information helps administrators (especially group administrators) to track course completion and follow up with learners to drive the adoption of the training program.

To access the Learner Report Card View, you need to select a user from the group details page or All Users list page.

In this article, you will learn more about different metrics and reports available to the administrator for individual learner analytics for all the enrolled courses.

## Permissions Level

The Community Training management portal provides role-based administration and depending on the access level, administrators can perform certain actions. The table below shows the administrative roles that can access the group view:  

|Access Level  |Learner Report Card View|

## Overview metrics

This section of the Learner Report Card View enables the admin to get a quick summary of the overall status of learner progress across all the enrolled courses. As shown in the image below, you will find the following three metrics:

1. **Course Registrations**: Shows the total number of courses a learner has been enrolled in or registered for.

2. **Course Completion**:  Shows the total number of courses a learner has completed.

3. **Average assessment Score**: Show the average assessment score across all the courses where learners have attempted the non-graded and graded assessments.

## Detailed progress and performance on registred courses

This section of the Learner Report Card View provides details on the learning progress and performance for each course in a grid view. As shown in the image below, for each course, you will see the following metrics:

1. **Learner Access Restricted to Course** - This lock icon defines if the course is restricted for the learner at that stage because they have not completed other courses. This can happen when course ordering is restricted in a Learning Path.

2. **Course Name** – Name of the course the user has been enrolled in.

3. **Average Assessment Score** - Show the average assessment score across all the assessments attempted by learners. If there are no assessments in the course, then this column will be set to Not Applicable.

4. **% Course Progress** – Number of lessons completed by learners for a course.

5. **Assessment Completed** - Number of assessments completed by learners for a course.

6. **Enrolled On** – The date on which the learner was enrolled for the course.

7. **Priority** - Priority of the course for the learner: can be Required, Recommended, Optional or Default. If the learner has been assigned the same course from multiple groups, the highest priority is shown here.
