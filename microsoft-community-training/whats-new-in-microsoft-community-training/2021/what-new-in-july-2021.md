# What's new in July 2021

Fighting the pandemic for more than a year now has been extremely tough and has posed numerous challenges for the entire world. Just like everyone else, the Community Training Team emerged even stronger and found means to contribute.

Today, we are excited to share the new Community Training product update with you! The new features are testimony to the fact that your feedback is critical for the platform’s success and we have been acting on it ensuring you can seamlessly deliver online learning to your community.

## Content Localization

Course translations are an important tool for administrators when the same content can be made available to the learners in their language of choice. This release will enable the administrators to [create course translations](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-4---create-multiple-translations-of-a-course) in different languages.

## Certificate custom text

Until now the platform allowed you to customize the look and feel of the certificate while the text was pre-defined. In this release, we have added the capability to allow  [customization of the certificate text](../../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md#customize-certificate-text) and optionally also include additional profile field values in the text.

## Support for custom homepage template

In this release, we have added the capability to [replace the default home page with any custom home page of choice](../../infrastructure-management/configure-your-platform-infrastructure/set-up-custom-homepage-for-your-mct-instance.md). The custom home page can be hosted in the same Azure subscription where the training platform is deployed.

## Feedback Form

This release introduces the capability to [add a feedback form to the courses](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-feedback-form-for-a-course.md) on the training platform to get active feedback on courses from the learners. Learners can share course feedback during or after course completion.

## Edit profile field of learners

A learner's profile on the training platform consists of mandatory fields like first name, last name unique identity (such as email, phone number, or username), and additional profile fields defined by the Global Administrators.
With this new release, Global Administrators will now be able to [edit these profile fields](../../user-management/manage-users/edit-user-profile-on-the-platform.md) of the learners directly from the Admin portal.

## Link to external website on learner homepage

In this release, we have enabled you to [provide a link to an external website on the learner’s homepage](../../settings/link-to-external-website-on-learner-Homepage.md) for allowing the learners quick access to a preferred website. This can be used for additional resources or branding purposes as required.

## Learner language change post login

Learners can now [switch the language of the portal](../../learner-experience/web-app.md#step-3-choose-the-language) even after signing in to the platform. The available languages would be now present as a drop-down in the platform for the learner to easily switch between languages.

## New application configurations

Administrators can now customize the learner experience to some more extent with features like [skipping uploaded videos](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md#allow-learners-to-skip-videos), [hiding course library section](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md#hide-course-library), etc. To get more information about all the application configuration, you may refer to the documentation [Configurations on the Training Platform - Settings](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md).
