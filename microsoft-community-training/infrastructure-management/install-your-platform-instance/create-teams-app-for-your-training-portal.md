1. Select **Configuration** under settings from the left-menu.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Teams SSO MultiTenant 2.png" alt-text="Teams SSO 2":::

1. Go to the **Applications Settings** tab

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Teams SSO MultiTenant 3.png" alt-text="Teams SSO 3":::

1. Search for `Features:IsMultiOrgDeployment`, add this if it does not exist, set the **value** to *True*, then select **Ok** to confirm.
1. Next, search for `idp:AzureADExternalAuthTenantId`, add this application setting if it does not exist using **New application setting** option.
1. Set the **value** to *common* replacing the existing Tenant ID keeping a copy of your original Tenant ID value as a reference, then select **Ok**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Teams SSO MultiTenant 4.png" alt-text="Teams SSO4":::

1. Whilst in the Configurations section, search for `idp:AzureADExternalAuthTenant` and note the Tenant name then search for `idp:AzureADExternalAuthClientId` and note the Client ID.
1. Navigate to your tenant (tenant name that you noted from Step 9) where your AAD exists, select **App registrations** then search for the application which corresponds to your Client ID noted from Step 10.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Teams SSO MultiTenant 5.png" alt-text="Teams SSO 5":::

1. Select the application, navigate to ‘Authentication’ then select *Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)* under **Supported account types** and select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/Teams SSO MultiTenant 6.png" alt-text="Teams SSO 6":::

1. For each tenant follow these steps:

      * [Install the Microsoft Teams App for your organization](#step-3---install-the-microsoft-teams-app-for-your-organization).
      * [Setup app policies to pin the training application from the Microsoft Team admin center](#step-4---setup-app-policies-to-pin-the-training-application-from-the-microsoft-team-admin-center).

1. Setup app policies to pin the training application from the Microsoft Team admin center.
