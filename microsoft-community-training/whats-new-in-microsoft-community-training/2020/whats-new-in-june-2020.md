# What's new in June 2020
As the world fights with the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that you are safe and are continuing your online training programs with Community Training. Amid this crisis, we’re excited to share the new product update with you! These updates will go live on your training platform instance by the end of the week. There are some great features in this release designed to help you manage and seamlessly deliver online learning to your communities. 

## Customize certificate template from the admin portal   
In this release, we have [enhanced the process to customize the certificates](../../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md) issued to learners’ post-course completion. Organization administrators can now upload customized certificate designs with organization-specific branding directly on the admin portal of the platform and preview the certificate sample before approving it to be issued to the learners.

## Default country code based on learner’s location  
In this update, we have added a new feature to the phone-based authentication process on the platform. The country code on the phone login screen of the web and mobile app will now default to a country based on the learner’s IP address. For instance, if a learner signs in to the platform from South Africa, then the country code by default is set to South Africa.

## Upload EPUB content for lessons in a course   
Like other content types such as HTML, PDF, and video, in this update, we have added support to [upload and manage EPUB files](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md) as lesson content within a course. Content admins can now add e-books in EPUB format as lessons for the learners. 

## Improvement in language support on the platform 

1. Customize the default language on the platform 
   In this update, we have released a new setting that allows you to enable languages directly from the management portal and mark any of the enabled languages as the default language. This will ensure that the learners view the platform in their native language with no additional setting. For more details, check [this article](../../settings/customize-languages-for-the-learners-on-the-platform.md).

2. Support for new languages on the platform 
   Based on customer requirements, we keep adding support for new languages on the platform. In this release we have added support for the following languages for the learners – Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Tajik, Tetum, Albanian, and Serbian.

3. Support for ligatures and accented characters
   In this release, we have made enhancements to ensure that ligatures and accented characters in languages such as Arabic, Hindi, and Lithuanian render accurately in the lesson content, certificate text, and overall, on the platform.  

## User experience improvements on the platform  

1. **URL redirection to the course content**
   In this release, we have provided admins with the capability to use URLs to point learners directly to the lesson list view within a course. Course URLs shared with the learners via API integrations, QR scan codes or direct link share will point learners directly to the course post login, skipping the home page.   

2. **Warning against skipping video lessons**
   In this release, we have enhanced the video lesson experience on the learner side. Learners will be prompted with a warning message on trying to skip a lesson when viewing it for the first time. This will ensure more accurate completion statistics for video lessons uploaded on the platform

3. **PDF lesson rotation on web application**
   In this release, we have enhanced the PDF lesson experience on the learner side. Learners will be able to click on the rotate button to view the PDF lessons in landscape and portrait mode as needed on the web application as well.

4. **Icons based on lesson content type in admin view**
   In this release, we have added the capability to show lesson icons based on the lesson content type to admins. Admins will be able to view unique lesson icons based on the format of the uploaded lesson file such as PDF, PPT, HTML, etc.
