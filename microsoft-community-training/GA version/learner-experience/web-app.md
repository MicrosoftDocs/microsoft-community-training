# Learner Experience on the web portal

This article explains how learners can access training content using the web portal for your organization's Community Training setup.

## Step 1: Sign in to your learning portal

1. Open the web browser and visit the Community Training platform instance for your organization. For example: [**fabrikamlearning.azurewebsites.net/**](https://fabrikamlearning.azurewebsites.net/)

    :::image type="content" source="../media/image(173).png" alt-text="A screenshot of the home page.":::

2. On the home page, select the **Sign In**  or  **Get Started** button.

3. Depending on the [**login identity setup**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/configure-login-social-work-school-account.md), you'll be asked to sign in using your 10-digit mobile number, email address, social account, or Azure Active Directory account.

## Step 2: Create your profile

### For new users

1. When you sign in to the platform for the first time, you'll be asked to complete your profile information (or at least the mandatory fields).

2. The fields displayed on the profile page are configured by the administrator. For more information, see [**Customize profile information for learners on the platform**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md).

3. Complete the profile information and select **Get Started**.

### For existing users

1. Select the profile icon on the top right corner of the learner view page. Then select **My profile**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/Profile Field - edit from learner view 0.PNG" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to select the profile icon.":::
    :::image type="content" source="../media/Profile Field - edit from learner view 1.PNG" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to edit from learner view.":::

2. Modify the profile field(s) as required.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/Profile Field - edit from learner view 2.PNG" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to edit profile fields.":::

    >[!TIP]  
    >You can now search for the relevant value from a long list of profile field values your admin has provided. For example, you can search for your city name from a list of all cities in your country or region.

3. Select **Confirm**, then select **Done**.

## Step 3: Choose the language

1. After setting up the profile, you can change the language from the dropdown in the navigation bar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/LearnerLanguage1.png" alt-text="Learner language drop down":::

2. Select the dropdown and choose a language from the available options.

3. Content on the homepage will be updated based on your chosen language. Refer to [**Course Translations**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-4---create-multiple-translations-for-a-course) to understand how language change impacts the learner view.

>[!Note]  
>Only the languages enabled by the Global administrator will be available for selection. The dropdown will not be available to learners if only one language is enabled on the platform.

## Step 4: Browse and register for courses

1. After signing in, you can see all the registered courses and their completion status.

## Step 5: Access and learn course content

1. On the **My Course** page, select the course item which you want to view and learn.

2. Every course consists of a course description, lessons, and assessments as shown in the course outline. Any completed course item gets a green circled tick mark:

3. To view any lesson content or attempt an assessmenet select the course item in the outline.

4. A graded assessment is always the last item in each course and it's available only when you have completed all the previous course items.
