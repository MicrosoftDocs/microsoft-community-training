By default, your training portal is hosted on ***\<name>.azurefd.net***   where ***\<name>**** is the website name entered by administrator at the time of platform deployment and installation. 

## Why configure a Custom Domain?
Some customers may prefer to keep their domain name at different providers for branding and trust purposes. We give you the option to “map” your learning portal to a domain of your choice.

If you’re looking to host your Microsoft Community Training instance on a custom domain of your choice, follow the instructions below.

## Before you begin
1.	Make sure you’ve purchased a domain name of your choice from your domain provider (such as Namecheap, GoDaddy).
2.	Make sure you have access to the DNS registry for your domain provider. For example, to add DNS entries for *contoso.com* and *www.contoso.com*, you must be able to configure the DNS settings for the *contoso.com*  root domain.

## Steps to configure your custom domain URL

1. [**Map the custom DNS name**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain#create-a-cname-dns-record) to point to your Microsoft Community Training instance, using a CNAME DNS record.

2. [**Associate the mapped custom domain**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain#associate-the-custom-domain-with-your-front-door), with your Microsoft Community Training instance's Front Door resource.

3. [**Configure the SSL certificate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https) for your Microsoft Community Training instance.
Use an [**AFD managed certificate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https#option-1-default-use-a-certificate-managed-by-front-door) for seamless certificate management, including procurement and renewal.

4. Enable Web Application Firewall on your new domain.
    (the setting is available just below the Custom Domain HTTPS configuration)
    Select the WAF policy instance that is deployed in the same resource group.
    
5. Click on the resource group belonging to your Microsoft Community Training instance.

6. Click on the Managed application instance.

8. Select the resource for your App Service.

9. From the left-menu, under Settings, click on **Configuration**.

10. Update the setting **ContentEndpoint** with your custom domain name, followed by the path "/storage". *For example - https://contosolearning.contoso.com/storage*.

11.	Next based on your chosen identity type, follow the steps below: 
* **For Social Accounts or email based authentication** like Google, Microsoft and Facebook [follow these steps](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/setup-custom-domain-url#for-social-accounts-like-google-microsoft-and-facebook)
* **For Azure Active Directory** (aka Work or School account) [follow these steps](https://docs.microsoftcommunitytraining.com/docs/setup-custom-domain-url#for-azure-active-directory-work-or-school-account)
* **For phone number authentication**, create a support ticket from [Microsoft Community Training Helpdesk](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630) using the following values. Our support team will activate your custom URL in 2-3 business days and notify you of the change.

 |Field	|Description|
|---|---|
|Title	|Enter "Set up custom domain URL"|
|Type	|Select "Request"|
|Subject|	Under Infrastructure Management, select "Set up custom domain URL"|
|Description|	Provide your existing URL and new custom URL| 

:::(Error) (Important Reminder)
Before raising the support ticket for an instance **enabled with Phone number authentication**, please make sure your training portal is accessible with the configured custom domain. After opening the website, when you click on the **SIGN IN** the login page should return an error.

## Troubleshoot for Custom Domain URL Setup
Following are some troubleshooting steps for the scenario when your website is not reachable even after following all of the above mentioned steps, 
![image.png](../../media/image%28341%29.png)

Check the DNS entry is propagated by any online tool available. [Example](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx).
There can be 2 cases:
(a). No entry is present 
![image.png](../../media/image%28342%29.png)

**Steps to mitigate**  
Update dns record in corresponding DNS provider. In the above case, the domain was purchased from Microsoft 365, so you will need to follow this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/dns/update-dns-records-to-retain-current-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide).
 Every dns provider will have similar documentations. This is one more example from [Godaddy](https://in.godaddy.com/help/change-an-a-record-19239)  
 
 (b). DNS entry is wrong
![image.png](../../media/image%28343%29.png)

**Steps to mitigate** 
The domain record should point to the correct AzureFD url (***\<name>.azurefd.net*** ). For example,
