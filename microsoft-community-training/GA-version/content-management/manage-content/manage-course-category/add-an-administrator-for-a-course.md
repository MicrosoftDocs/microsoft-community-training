# Add an administrator for a course

There are two types of content administrators in the Community Training platform: Category administrator and Course administrator. There is no limit to the number of either type of administrator.

1. **Category administrator** is responsible for content creation and management of all the courses under one or more categories on the portal.

2. **Course administrator** is responsible for content creation and management of one or more courses on the portal.

> [!TIP]  
> A user can be both a category administrator as well as a course administrator on the portal. For example, an employee from the HR department will be responsible for creating and maintaining all the courses under the compliance category but the same employee may only be responsible for managing courses related to soft skills under the career development category. In such scenarios, the employee will be added as category administrator for the compliance category and course administrator for soft skills courses under the career development category.

In this article, you will learn how to add different types of content administrator admin on the management portal.
