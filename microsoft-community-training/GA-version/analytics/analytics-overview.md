# Analytics overview

Community Training provides out-of-the-box rich analytics for tracking progress in learning, course completion, and engagement and performance of learners. These insights enable administrators to monitor progress and improvise training programs. Analytics empower the organization to make improved decisions about their training program which is always supported by data and behavior of users, and in turn, this enables intelligent program administration.

## Role-based admin access to analytics

Analytics on the management portal are accessible to Global Admins, Organization Admins, Learning Path Admins, Category Admins, Course Admins, and Group Admins. Depending on the administrative role, users will have access to relevant reports and dashboards on the platform.

For example, the Global Admin can access all the learner analytics on the portal; the Organization Admin can access all analytics for a given organization; the Category Admin can access learner analytics for complete a category and its courses; the Course Admin can access learner analytics for the course and a Group Admin can access learner analytics only for the users in the group.

Here is a high-level comparison of analytics information available to different admins:
