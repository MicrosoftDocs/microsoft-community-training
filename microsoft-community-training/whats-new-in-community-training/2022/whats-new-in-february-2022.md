Now administrators can add multiple correct answers to a question. It is also possible to [add answer explanations](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-assessments-to-a-course.md#add-non-graded-and-graded-assessments-to-a-course).

## Changes in DB/API

* Please refer to the DB changes made for this release [DB Schema](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-community-training/files/7889844/MCT_DB_Schema_Jan2022.pdf)
* If you are planning to reuse (download and upload) course content across instances, please ensure that both instances are on latest release as we've made changes to meta-date schema in this release.

* If you are planning to reuse (download and upload) questions across instances, due to file format changes, you now have to update the [csv template](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-community-training/files/8015610/Sample.CSV.-.Quiz.csv).
