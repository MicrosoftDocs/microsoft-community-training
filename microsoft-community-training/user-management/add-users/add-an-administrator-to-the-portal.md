# Add administrators to the platform

The Community Training plaform provides six types of administrative roles on the portal: Global Administrator, Organization Administrator, Learning Path Administrator, Category Administrator, Course Administrator and Group Administrator. For more details, see the article on [**roles and responsibilities of different administrators**](../../get-started/user-role-and-management-portal-overview.md).

> [!Note]  
> In case of Microsoft Teams integration, you won't be able to create Group administrator on the platform.  Group admin privileges are automatically assigned to owners of the Teams imported on the Community Training platform.
