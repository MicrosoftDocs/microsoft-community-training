# Customize the certificate template for the platform

By default, Community Training platform uses a basic template to issue certificates to learners who have completed a course or passed an exam as shown below. Organization can customize the certificate template and put their own branding as required. You can create and assign multiple certificates appropriate to the course.

## Customize Certificate Text

The above default certificate text HTML can be customized to alter the text, existing data fields and including custom profile fields. The default certificate text on the platform is as follows,

```Default Certificate Text
<div style='text-align:center;font-size:1em;line-height:1.7em'>
This is to certify that
<div style='font-size:1.2em'>
    <b>[First Name] [Last Name]</b>
</div>
<div>
    has successfully completed the course
</div>
<b>[Course Name]</b>
<div>
    offered by [Instance Name] on [Course Completion Date] with a score of [Average Exam Score]%.
</div>
</div>
```

### Standard Placeholders

The Standard Placeholders are the data fields that can be used by default on any instance of the platform. The fields enabled for the certificate template are,

|Placeholders for Course certificate| Placeholders for Learning Path certificate|
|---|---|
|[First Name]|[First Name]|
|[Last Name]|[Last Name]|
|[Unique Identity]|[Unique Identity]|
|[Course Name]|[Learning Path Name]|
|[Course Completion Date]|[Learning Path Completion Date]|
|[Instance Name]|[Instance Name]|
|[Average Exam Score]|N/A|
|[Maximum Exam Score]|N/A|

### Custom Placeholders

The Custom Placeholders are the data fields for the Additional Profile fields that are created custom on any instance of the platform.

To include **additional profile fields**, the placeholder should be as **[Field:{Additional Profile field name}]**. For example: For the profile field name "Country", the placeholder should be [Field:Country]

An additional profile field can be,

* **Text field** -  The Text field placeholder will be replaced with the field value. Example: “[Field:City]” will be replaced with “Hyderabad” on the certificate for the learner.
* **Single Choice field** - The Single Choice field placeholder will be replaced with the field value. Example: “[Field:Color]” will be replaced with “Blue” on the certificate for the learner.
* **Multiple Choice field** – The Multiple Choice field placeholder will be replaced with comma separated values. Example: “[Field:Interests]” will be replaced with “Music, Football, Reading” on the certificate for the learner.

```Sample Certificate Text with Additional Profile Field 'Country'
<div style='text-align:center;font-size:1.5em;line-height:1.7em'>
This is to certify that
<div style='font-size:1.2em'>
    <b>[First Name] [Last Name]</b>
</div>
<div>
    from [Field:Country] has successfully completed the course
</div>
<b>[Course Name] </b>
<div>
offered by [Instance Name] on [Course Completion Date].
</div>
</div>
```

Once the certificate text is updated, you can click on **preview** to view the certificate.
