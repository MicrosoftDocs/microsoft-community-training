# What's new in March 2021

With the world gradually recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and adopting the new normal as the way forward,  Community Training has also worked its way to add more capabilities for customized skilling and better platform management. Numerous features have been introduced to ensure improved learner experience and more control of content and user management. We hope you enjoy using the platform.

## Learning Path of courses for learners*

This release introduces the [concept of **Learning Path**](../../content-management/create-content/create-learning-path/create-a-learning-path.md) which is a defined sequence of courses on the platform to administer guided training paths for the learners. It provides instructors the ability to control the way courses are assigned to learners and offers a clear-cut road map for learners regarding what they are supposed to achieve.

## Manage the platform more efficiently with the new Administration Hierarchy*

The platform has introduced a [new administrative hierarchy](../../get-started/user-role-and-management-portal-overview.md#types-of-user-roles-in-community-training). The complete administrative access of the platform resides with the Global Administrator. Under the Global Administrators, you can have multiple Organization Administrators who can manage both content and users for their respective organizations. Under each Organization Administrator, there could be multiple Learning Path Administrators, Category Administrators, Course Administrators, and Group Administrators.

## Prioritize courses while assigning them to learners*

Administrators would now be able to [assign priorities to the courses](../../user-management/manage-users/assign-content-to-group-users.md) being assigned to the learners.

Based on these priorities, the learner would be able to focus first on critical things and plan their learnings in a better way.

## View your holistic progress from new Learner's Dashboard*

The learners on the platform would now be able to gauge their learning progress by [viewing the personalized dashboard](../../learner-experience/web-app.md#step-6-view-progress) available on the platform. The dashboard will have a birds-eye view of the total courses completed, total certificates received, and more.

> [!WARNING]
> The new features mentioned above with '*' are available only on the web version of the portal and not on the mobile application.
