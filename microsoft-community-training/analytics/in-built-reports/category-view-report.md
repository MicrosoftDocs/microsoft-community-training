# Category View

Similar to the overall summary view, Category View provides admins a quick glance at learner registrations, and course completion for a particular category. It provides insights on content quality, facilitates comparative analytics across courses in a category, and enables admins to notice things that require attention.

To access the Category View, you can select a specific row from the category grid in the overall summary view page.

In this article, you will learn more about different metrics and reports available to administrators as part of learner analytics for a specific category.

## Insights on learner registration and course completion

### Course registration over time

The graph provides information about all learners enrolled for all the courses under a specific category over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph.

The values that are measured are:  

* x-axis — Timeline.
* y-axis — Number of unique learners registered across all courses under a category.

As shown in the image below, there were 39 unique learners enrolled on the portal in June.

 This comparative insight helps admins to take further action to improve the course content or to engage learners effectively.

### Course registration and completion over time

The graph provides information about total course enrollment and course completion across all the courses under a given category over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph. The values that are measured are:

* x-axis — Timeline
* y-axis — Total number of course registrations/completion across all courses under a category

As shown in the image below, there are four course completions for the courses in the Healthcare category.

This view gives a graphical representation of the growth in the number of course enrollments and course completions for all courses for a given category over a period. The data presented can help take corrective measures if the course completion curve falls below the course enrolment curve by a wide margin.

### Top courses by completion

This section provides information on popular courses by completions for a given category. This comparative insight helps admins to take further action to improve the course content or to engage learners effectively.
