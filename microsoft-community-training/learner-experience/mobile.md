# Learner Experience on the mobile app

This article explains how learners can access training content using the Android mobile application for the Community Training setup of your organization.

## Step 1: Download the app from the Play Store

1. Open the Google Play Store app on your Android smartphone.

2. Search for the training app and install the application.

3. Once the app is installed, tap the app icon to launch the app.

> [!NOTE]
> Community Training provides every organization with a custom white-labeled mobile app. Learners are provided with the name of the training app by the administrator, once it's published on the Play Store.

## Step 2: Sign in and create your profile

1. On app launch, you'll be asked to sign in to access the application.

2. Depending upon the [**login identity setup**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/configure-login-social-work-school-account.md) for the platform instance, you'll be asked to sign in using your 10-digit mobile number, email address, social account, or Azure Active Directory account.

4. The fields displayed on the profile page are configured by the administrator. For more information, see [**this article**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md).
