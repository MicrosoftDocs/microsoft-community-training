# Learner Experience on (PWA-based) mobile app

This article explains how learners can access training content using the [Progressive Web App (PWA) based Android mobile application](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md#option-1-creating-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-for-android) for the Community Training setup of your organization.

## Step 1: Download the app

### Option 1: Install from Play store

1. Open the Google Play Store app on your Android smartphone.

2. Search for the training app and install the application.

3. Once the app is installed, tap the app icon to launch the app.

> [!Note]  
> Community Training enables every organization to create a custom white-labeled mobile app. Learners are provided with the name of the training app published on the Play Store by the administrator.

### Option 2: Install from the browser

1. For mobile devices (Android), you can install PWA by selecting the  **Add to home screen** prompt that you receive while browsing Community Training instance or selecting **install app** from browser options.

> [!Note]  
> The learner experience is the same for both installation options.

## Step 2: Sign in and create your profile

1. On app launch, you'll need to sign in to access the application.

2. Depending on the [**login identity setup**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/configure-login-social-work-school-account.md), you'll need to sign in using your email address, social account, or Azure Active Directory account.

3. After sign-in, you'll need to complete your profile information including first name, last name, profile picture, and more.  

4. The fields displayed on the profile page are configured by the administrator. For more information, see [**Customize profile information for learners**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md).

## Step 3: Choose language

1. After setting up the profile, you can choose to change the language from the dropdown at the top of the portal.

2. Content on the home page will be updated based on your chosen language. Refer to [**Course Translations**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-4---create-multiple-translations-for-a-course) to understand how language change impacts your learner view.

>[!Note]  
>Only the languages enabled by the Global administrator will be available for selection. The dropdown will not be available to learners if only one language is enabled on the platform.

## Step 4: Browse and register for courses

1. After signing in, you can see all the registered learning paths and  Courses along with their completion status.

## Step 5: View and consume course content

1. On the **My Course** page, select the Course item which you want to view and learn.

2. Every course consists of a course description, lessons, and assessments (graded or non-graded). You will see a green circled tick mark once a course item is completed.

3. To view any lesson content or attempt an assessment, select the course item in the outline.

4. On successful completion of the course, you'll receive a certificate if enabled by the administrator.

## Step 6: Download content and continue learning offline

1. Tap on the course item you would like to download and select the **Download** button:
