Microsoft Community Training platform allows trainers to add assessments as a way to evaluate learners on their knowledge and proficiency. The platform provides two types of assessments in the form of Practice Quiz and Exam containing one or more multiple-choice questions.

**Practice Quiz** - A Practice Quiz serves as a refresher for learners and facilitate revision of a particular lesson. There is no limit to the number of Practice Quizzes you can add to a course. 

**Exam**  -  An Exam is used to evaluate learners on their proficiency and knowledge in a particular course to measure learning outcome. Unlike practice quiz, an exam has limited number of attempts and a passing percentage as specified by the trainer.

In this article, you will learn more about how to add assessments to a course followed by an overview on sample assessment question types, in respective sections:

## Bulk upload questions for a practice quiz or exam
In this topic, you will learn how to bulk upload questions for a practice quiz or exam in the management portal:

### Prerequisite for bulk upload questions
Before you start doing the bulk upload of questions for a practice quiz or exam, you need to make sure the question list is structured in the right format on your local machine. The steps below provide information on how to create and verify that the question list is in the correct format:

#### Step 1 - Download the sample CSV file

1.	Click or tap on the **Import CSV** icon to the top right of Practice Quiz or Exam card. 
![Import CSV icon](../../../media/Import%20CSV%20icon.png){height="150" width="400"}

3.	In the bulk upload panel, download the sample CSV and save on your local machine.
![Import CSV bar](../../../media/Import%20CSV%20bar.png){height="" width="250"}

#### Step 2 – Edit the sample CSV file to create question list 

1.	Open the sample csv file in Microsoft Excel.

2.	Remove the sample questions from the CSV file.
@(Info)(Important)(Do not remove the column headers from the CSV file.)

3.	Start adding 1 question per row with the following information under each column header:
    * Serial Number – put the sequence number of the question in the list.  
    * Question Title – put the question text in this field. 
    * Choice 1 to N – add the choices for the question. 
    * Answer – select the correct number among the choices. For e.g. set value to 2 if Choice 2 is the correct answer.
![CSV file format](../../../media/CSV%20file%20format.png)

4.	Rename and save the edited file once you are done creating the question list. When editing the CSV file, please take care of the following things:
    * Do not add **comma (,)** in the question or choices when editing the sample file 
    * Use **semi-colon (;) as delimiter** when adding multiple values for a single option  
    * For any cell, do not split the text into multiple lines (i.e. do not use **ALT + Enter**)

:::(Info) (Note)
There may be questions with different number of choices. For questions which have fewer choices, add some placeholder values while uploading from CSV. Later, remove these options after upload. 

For example, there are 5 questions in the list – first 3 questions have 4 choices each and remaining 2 questions have only 2 choices, add as placeholder value for choice 3 and choice 4 in the CSV file for the last two questions.
:::

#### Step 3 – Verify the CSV file before uploading
1.	Open the question list csv file in Notepad. **Right Click > Open with > Notepad**. 

2.	Remove Word Wrap formatting from the tool bar. **Format > Word Wrap**.

3.	Verify the structure of the file is correct by ensuring the following things:
    * For each question row, number of commas (,) is one less than the number of column headers
    * For each question, there should not be any line break i.e. question must be contained in a single line.
    * For each question, there is no blank values for the choices.

4.	In case you find any issues with the file, edit and correct the structure as described in the previous step.
