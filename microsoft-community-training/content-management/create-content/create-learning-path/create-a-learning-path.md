# Create a Learning path

A **Learning Path** is a defined sequence of courses on the training platform to administer guided training paths to the learners. It provides instructors the ability to control the way courses are assigned to learners and offers clear-cut road-map for learners regarding what they are supposed to achieve.

A Learning Path references courses from different Categories on the training platform which learners can be optionally enforced to complete in an order. A Learning Path can be assigned by the administrators to a individual or group of users.

In this article, you will learn more about how to create Learning Path(s) on the Microsoft Community Training platform.
