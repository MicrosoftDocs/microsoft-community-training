# Web & Mobile App

## Learner experience

### I can't open external links embedded inside the PDF document in the platform

For security reasons, we have disabled clicking on external links for the PDF document on the platform. Hence, you should not add any links to the PDF lesson file.

### Can learners change/update user profile fields?

Learners can change/update profile fields via the profile section in the portal. Administrators can change these values via the bulk upload functionality. Refer to [**this article**](../user-management/organize-users/add-multiple-users-to-the-group.md#steps-to-bulk-upload-users-to-specific-group) for more information.

### Can Community Training be used in low bandwidth and no internet connectivity scenarios?

Community Training is designed to be lightweight and supports adaptive streaming for seamless content consumption for low network connectivity scenarios:

* For video content, it supports streaming under all network speeds – 100 kbps, 256 kbps, 2G as well as 3G.

* For other content types like PDF and doc files, the complete content needs to be downloaded before learners can start consuming the content.

* On the mobile app, learners can also download the content and consume it in offline mode.

### How can learners search for courses on the platform?

After successful login, learners can see all the courses for which they have registered and their completion status.

Users can also browse the course library and register for more courses as required.

## Course consumption

### How to restrict users from viewing the courses until they sign in

There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Create a custom home page  

   You can create a custom HTML landing page with a sign-in button. The landing page can be designed to have any information about your organization or training program. When user selects login, you can direct them to the sign-in flow and on successful login, users will shown the My Course Page.

2. Mark all the course as admin only by following the below steps  
   * Sign in to Management portal as an administrator with access to the courses
   * Select the Course and select **More (…)**
   * Select **Edit course**
   * In Learner Enrollment options, select **Only admin can enroll learners**

### Can learners switch the audio language just like how they can select the subtitle language on the web and mobile app?

The platform currently doesn't support adding multiple audio for lesson content. However, we recommend customers create multiple courses for different languages and upload respective files to achieve the use cases with existing features.

Example: A customer wants to upload a course called “How to use Microsoft Word” in different languages such as English, French, Hindi, etc. The customer can then create different course categories with appropriate course tiles such as

* “How to use Microsoft Word - English”
* “How to use Microsoft Word - French”
* “How to use Microsoft Word - Hindi”

Learners can easily navigate and select their preferred language.

### How can learners download a certificate from the phone?

The certificate is provided in PDF format, hence you can download it on your phone by saving it as a PDF.

### Can the learner download or share their course completion certificate on social media websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.?

Yes, once learners have completed the course and unlocked the certificate, they will be able to save and share it on social media platforms.

## Content download & offline mode

### Will learners be able to download course content on their devices for offline consumption?

Learners can download content only on the mobile app. To download the content, learners would require an active internet connection.

### Can learner download content for offline consumption on their device?

On the web portal, learners cannot download the lesson content except if it is an Office document like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. For example, if you are uploading Video, PDF, Audio, HTML, or ePUB as lesson content then learners would not be allowed to download the content on their local device.

On the mobile app, learners are allowed to download the content for offline consumption. Even after downloading, learners will have to open the mobile app to consume the training content. They cannot access content outside the app.

Please note that downloaded content can be viewed only from within the Community Training mobile app and all the learning progress will be synced whenever the device comes back online.

### Can I disable the downloading of video and other course content for learners on the web and mobile app?

Learners accessing the platform using a web (PC / Mac) or mobile browser  (Android / iOS) will not be able to download video or audio content that is hosted on the platform; however, they will be able to download certain file types such as Word, and PowerPoint.

Learners accessing the platform using the Android app will be able to download content such as Video, audio & documents. The downloaded content is accessible only via the mobile app and not out of the app, like YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc.

The below chart illustrates the download possibilities based on the content type and platform the learner is accessing:

### How to restrict users from downloading course material on mobile apps

Download functionality on the mobile app is turned on by default and cannot be disabled. However, the downloaded content can only be consumed within the app and is not accessible outside the mobile app. This ensures that learners won’t be able to share content with others.

## Discussion forum & announcement

### Are there discussion forums or comment sessions available on the platform for Q&A?

There is an inbuilt comment session available for every lesson. While accessing the training content, learners can use a discussion forum to add/share comments and questions with others and stay informed on replies and feedback.

### Can I disable the comment functionality?

Yes, you can disable the comment functionality from the lessons. Once disabled, learners will not be allowed to post comments. By default, commenting for learners remains enabled. For more understanding, refer to [this article](../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md).

### Can learners communicate or ask questions with peers and trainers on the platform?

Community Training has a functionality called Discussion Forum which learners can use to ask questions to other participants, trainers, or administrators. Anyone who is registered for the course (or admins) can respond to these questions.

Refer this [**article**](../learner-experience/web-app.md#step-7-discuss-and-share-information-with-peers) for more information.

### What is the Discussion Forum feature?

Discussion Forums enable learners to ask their queries on a specific lesson which can be answered by administrators or interact with peers who are enrolled in the course.

### Who can post questions or respond to queries in the discussion forum?

All the enrolled learners for the course and course administrators will be able to post and respond to queries on the discussion forum.

### How can the administrators use the discussion forum to interact with learners?

Every lesson has a dedicated comment section where learners can place their questions. Administrators can easily navigate and provide real-time feedback and answers to the learner queries which makes it easy for them to interact with peers/mentors and get guidance.

### As an administrator, can I moderate queries and responses on the discussion forum?

Currently, Community Training doesn’t support deletion or editing questions & responses posted in the comment section. However, this is something on the roadmap.

### Can a learner ask questions to the instructor or subject matter expert in a private chat?

Community Training doesn’t support private chat or 1:1 discussion between learners and administrators. However, learners can connect with instructors using tools such as Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, etc.

### When I send an announcement, will learners receive notification via email or SMS?

When an announcement is sent by the administrators there messages appear on the Notice Board for the learner experience. In order to have additional functionalities such as SMS or Email, customers can leverage the APIs to build these functionalities using Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, etc.
