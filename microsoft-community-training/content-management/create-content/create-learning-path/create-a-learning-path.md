# Create a Learning path

A **Learning Path** is a defined sequence of courses on the training platform to administer guided training paths to the learners. It provides instructors the ability to control the way courses are assigned to learners and offers clear-cut road-map for learners regarding what they are supposed to achieve.

A Learning Path references courses from different Categories on the training platform which learners can be optionally enforced to complete in an order. A Learning Path can be assigned by the administrators to a individual or group of users.

In this article, you will learn more about how to create Learning Path(s) on the Microsoft Community Training platform.

## Permissions Level

The Microsoft Community Training management portal provides role-based administration and depending upon the type of access level the administrators can perform an action on the portal. The table below shows administrative role which are allowed to create Learning Paths on the portal:

| Access Level  | Create Learning Path |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | Yes |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | No |
| Group Administrator | No |

    1. If you have [multiple languages](../../../settings/customize-languages-for-the-learners-on-the-platform.md#customize-languages-on-the-platform) enabled for your instance, then you can add translations for your Learning Path fields.

5. Enter the **Learning Path Description**. The Learning Path description is a short summary which informs a learner about course content at the time of registration.

6. Choose  **Upload**  option to open file picker and select an image file as Learning Path Thumbnail.

7. Choose **Enable certificate**. This option enables the administrator to award certificate to learners after the learning path completion.

    >[!Note]
    >Administrator can [**customize the certificate template**](../../../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md#customize-the-certificate-template-for-the-platform) awarded to the learners at the time of learning path completion.

8. Choose **Restrict Ordering**. This option enables the administrator to restrict the learners to consume the courses in Learning Path in a sequence. Learners will NOT be allowed to skip courses within a Learning Path if this option is enabled.

9. Select the **Organization** for the Learning Path. By default, it is assigned to a default organization.

    > [!Note]
    > If your instance is Multi-Tenant enabled, refer [Enabling Global Content across organizations](../../content-management-overview.md#enabling-global-content-across-organizations), to have common Learning paths enabled across organizations.

10. Click or tap **Create** button to create the Learning Path.

**Next>** Once a Learning Path is created, the administrator can start  [**adding content to the Learning Path.**](add-course-to-a-learning-path.md)
