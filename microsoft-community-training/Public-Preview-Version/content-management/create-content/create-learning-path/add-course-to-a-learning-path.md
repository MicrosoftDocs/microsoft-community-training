# Add course to a Learning path

A **Learning Path** is a defined sequence of courses on the training platform to administrator guided training paths to the learners.

A Learning Path references courses from different Categories on the training platform which learners can be optionally enforced to complete in an order. [**Once a Learning Path is created**](create-a-learning-path.md), administrators can select one or more published courses from the same category or across categories to the Learning Path.

In this article, you will learn more about how to add courses to a Learning Path on the management portal.

## Permissions Level

The Microsoft Community Training management portal provides role-based administration and depending upon the type of access level admins can perform an action on the portal. Table below shows administrative role which are allowed to add courses to a Learning Path on the portal:

| Access Level  | Add courses to Learning Path |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | Yes |
| Course Administrator | No |
| Category Administrator | No |
| Group Administrator | No |

    >[!Tip]
    >You can also unselect Courses which will **de-assign that content** from the learners of that Learning Path. Hence, learners will not be able to view that content anymore. For more information, refer [this document](../../../user-management/manage-users/De-assigning-content-from-user.md).

6. Click on **Done**.

 **Next>** Once the Courses are added to the Learning Path, you can [**assign the Learning Path to user groups**](../../../user-management/manage-users/assign-content-to-group-users.md).
