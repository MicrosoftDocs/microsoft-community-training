# What's new in December 2020
As the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our day-to-day activities and led to months of isolation, the world has committed itself to finding ways to improve the situation and grow at the same time. 
Keeping the same enthusiasm, Community Training has yet again come up with a new product release. The new features have been designed in a way to keep the platform simple and yet offer more flexibility and control to manage communities. We hope you enjoy using the platform with a seamless learning experience.

## Restricted Course Assignment 
For large organizations, there are scenarios where the content of one group should not be accessible to other group users because of various security and IP concerns. 
With this new feature, the Organization Administrator can[ control access to group administrators](../../settings/restrict-content-access-to-group-administrators.md) so that they can only view courses inside their purview.

## Enable multiple Course Level Certificates templates
You can now [add multiple certificate templates](../../settings/enable-course-level-certificate.md) on the platform. For each course, it's possible to choose a custom certificate template from a drop-down enlisting all certificate templates.

## Disable Comments for learners
This feature provides you the flexibility to [disable the comments](../../settings/configurations-on-the-training-platform.md) for the entire instance. Once disabled, learners will not be allowed to post comments. By default, commenting for learners remains enabled.

## Increased the upload size limits for different file formats
You can now upload files with greater size on the platform. We have increased the cap to “No Limit” for most of the file formats that we support. Refer to [this link](../../frequently-asked-questions/faqs-course.md) for more information.

## Content Caching and Compression
All static assets (including uploaded content files) now support browser caching with appropriate Cache-Control headers. Further, all server responses are now compressed, resulting in significantly faster page load times across the application.

## Simplified identity creation for Microsoft work or school account
Configuring your login identity with [Microsoft Work or School account](../../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/configure-login-social-work-school-account.md) has been made much simpler with automation of steps using a easy to use script
