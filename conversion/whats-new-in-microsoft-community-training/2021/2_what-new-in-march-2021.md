# What's new in March 2021
With the world gradually recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and adopting the new normal as the way forward, Microsoft Community Training has also worked its way to add more capabilities for customized skilling and better platform management. Numerous features have been introduced to ensure improved learner experience and more control on content and user management. We hope you enjoy using the platform!!!

## Learning Path of courses for learners*
This release introduces the [concept of **Learning Path**](../../content-management/create-content/create-learning-path/2_create-a-learning-path) which is a defined sequence of courses on the platform to administer guided training paths for the learners. It provides instructors the ability to control the way courses are assigned to learners and offers clear-cut roadmap for learners regarding what they are supposed to achieve.

## Manage the platform more efficiently with the new Administration Hierarchy*
The platform has introduced a [new administrative hierarchy](../../get-started/3_user-role-and-management-portal-overview#types-of-user-personas-in-microsoft-community-training-platform). The complete administrative access of the platform resides with the Global Administrator. Under the Global Administrators, you can have multiple Organization Administrators who can manage both content and users for their respective organization. Under each Organization Administrator, their could be multiple Learning Path Administrators, Category Administrators, Course Administrators and Group Administrators.

## Prioritize courses while assigning them to learners*
Administrators would now be able to [assign priorities to the courses](../../user-management/manage-users/2_assign-content-to-group-users) being assigned to the learners. 

Based on these priorities, the learner would be able to focus first on critical things and plan their learanings in better way.

The learners on the platform would now be able to gauge their learning progress by [viewing the personalized dashboard](../../learner-experience/2_web-app#step-5-view-progress) available on the platform. Dasboard will have a birds-eye view of the total courses completed, total certificates received etc.

The new features mentioned above with '*' are available only on the web version of the portal and not on mobile application.
