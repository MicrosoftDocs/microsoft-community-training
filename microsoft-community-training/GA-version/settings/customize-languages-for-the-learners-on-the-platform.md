# Customize languages on the platform

By default, the Community Training platform is available in English to the learners. To support native learners, you can enable more languages and configure the default language for your platform instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Language support is for system generated strings only, not the content. Content can be added in any language as per the training requirements.

In this article, you'll learn how to customize languages and set the default language for the management portal.

## Permissions Level

The Community Training platform provides role-based permission levels.  The table below shows which administrative roles can customize languages for the platform.

|Access Level| Customize profile information |
|---|---|
|Global Administrator| Yes |
|Organization Administrator |No|
|Category Administrator|No|
|Learning Path Administrator|No|
|Course Administrator|No|
|Group Administrator|No|

      > [!Note]

1. Select **Apply Changes** to publish your changes.

      > [!CAUTION]  
      > Ensure you click on Apply Changes. Otherwise, the changes you made will be lost.

1. The chosen languages will be available for learners to select before signing in. The "**Default**" language will be the first language in the list and the portal will be viewable to the learner initially in that language.
