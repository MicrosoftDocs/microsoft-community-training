# Monitor your platform Infrastructure

## Azure Consumption and Costs
Your training portal is composed of various resources such as Azure SQL, Azure Media Service, Azure App Service etc. Each serve to provide your learners a complete learning experience. As your learners use the training portal, each of these resources get consumed and you get appropriately billed based on the usage. You can estimate your azure consumption cost for Microsoft Community Training platform [**here**](https://communitytraining.microsoft.com/pricing/). 

For more details, refer to [**Azure billing and cost management**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing) documentation to know more about your Azure consumption and monitor usage and costs of your training portal.

## Health and Performance
You can monitor the health and performance of your learning portal by leveraging Azure monitor. Azure monitor provides insights on the availability and performance of the resources of your learning portal by allowing you to collect, analyze, and act on telemetry from the resources of your learning portal. It helps you understand how your portal is performing and proactively identify issues affecting it and the resources it depends on.

For more details, refer to [**Azure Monitor Resource Group insights**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/resource-group-insights) documentation to know more about tracking performance and monitoring health for resource groups.

## Application Insights
To learn which features or pages of your learning portal are the most popular, least popular, most engaging, drop-off rates and retention pattern across the portal, you can leverage App Insights and make data driven decisions. You can also create custom reports on how your learners are performing on the learning portal.
