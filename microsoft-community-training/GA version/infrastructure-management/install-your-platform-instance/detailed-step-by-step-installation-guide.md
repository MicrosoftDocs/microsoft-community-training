# Detailed step by step installation guide


In this article, you’ll learn how to install and deploy the Community Training platform on your Azure subscription.

## Before you begin

### 1. Create a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription

Create a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. To learn more about how to create it, refer [**this article**](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) on Azure documentation.

If you have a free trial Azure subscription, please upgrade to a Pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. See the [**detailed steps here**](/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription#upgrade-your-azure-free-account). 

<!--
Hiding this until the work on this topic is complete
**We currently do not support Microsoft Community Training on free trial Azure subscriptions.**
-->

> [!WARNING]  
> If you’re a nonprofit organization who wants to use Microsoft Community Training platform, you can apply and avail the Azure grant subject to eligibility. See the [**detailed steps here**](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/eligibility?activetab=pivot1:primaryr4).

>[!Note]  
> If you are nonprofit, please make sure you are installing the Microsoft Community Training in the Microsoft Sponsored Subscription

### 2. Get the right ownership access

Get the **owner** access to your pay-as-you-go Azure subscription. To learn more about how to get access, refer [**this article**](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on Azure documentation.
