# Add course to a Learning path

A **Learning Path** is a defined sequence of courses on the training portal which provides guided training paths to the learners.

A Learning Path references courses from different Categories on the training platform which learners can complete in a specified order. [**Once a Learning Path is created**](create-a-learning-path.md), you can select one or more published courses across categories to assign to the Learning Path.

In this article, you will learn how to add courses to a Learning Path.

    > [!TIP]  
    >You can also unselect Courses which will **remove content** from the Learning Path. Learners will not be able to view that content anymore. For more information, refer [this document](../../../user-management/manage-users/De-assigning-content-from-user.md).

1. Select **Done** to confirm.

Once the Courses are added to the Learning Path, you can [**assign the Learning Path to user groups**](../../../user-management/manage-users/assign-content-to-group-users.md).
