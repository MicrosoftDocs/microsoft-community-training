By default, the Microsoft Community Training platform is available in English language to the learners. To support native learners, you can enable more languages and configure the default language for your platform instance. 
:::(Info) (Important)
Language support is **only** for system generated strings only, not the content. Content can be added in any language as per the training requirements.
