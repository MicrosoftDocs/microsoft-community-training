# Portal Branding & Customization

## Platform customization

### How do I customize languages for the platform?

Currently, we support 28 languages on the platform. You can enable languages for your training instance and set a default language, refer **[this article](../settings/customize-languages-for-the-learners-on-the-platform.md)** for the steps to add new languages on the platform.

### How do I change the look and feel of the portal?

You can change the look and feel according to your brand. Refer **[this article](../settings/configure-the-look-and-feel-of-your-portal.md)** to customize the look and feel of your portal.

### How do I customize the name and icon of training tab in MS Team?

You can customize the name and icon of training tab in MS Teams as per your requirements. Refer to [this article](../infrastructure-management/configure-your-platform-infrastructure/customize-the-name-and-icon-of-the-training-tab-in-ms-teams.md) to follow the steps for customization.

### We run programs for different centers in various locations, and often need a different front end to match the branding of the specific program. Is this possible?

Community Training doesn't support multiple homepages out of the box. However, you can customize and develop multiple standalone HTML pages (one for each program) with a link to login to the Learner view. Course assignment can be controlled by prompting the user to choose the employment center / program during the one-time sign up process.

For more information and support on how to enable this, please contact us via [**HelpDesk**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630).

### Can the landing page or homepage have a different design?

You can customize the landing page with a custom theme color, banner image and welcome text. Refer [**this article**](../settings/configure-the-look-and-feel-of-your-portal.md) to learn more.

Alternatively, you can create your own landing page and direct users to the training instance from the landing page.

For more information and support on how to enable this, please contact us via [**HelpDesk**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630).

### Is it possible to hide courses shown on the home page when web portal is opened?

Yes, it is possible and  can be achieved in two ways.

* **Method 1** : All the courses enrollment on the portal must be set to “Only admins can enroll users”. This way courses that are set to admin only will not be displayed on the home page.

* **Method 2** : You can have your own custom homepage and simply set redirection triggers to the sign-in page, which allows the customers to bypass our default homepage.

For more information and support on how to enable this, please contact us via [**HelpDesk**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104630).

### How to upload Privacy Statement & Terms and Conditions for users to read at the time of sign up?

You can upload your own privacy statement by logging in as an administrator to the management portal and follow the below steps:

1. Go to Settings -> General
2. Enable the Show Privacy Terms toggle button
3. Add a link to your organization's privacy terms and conditions.

For detailed steps,  [**refer here**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md#add-privacy-terms-and-conditions).

### How many profile fields can I configure as an administrator to capture learner details ?

Community Training allows adding upto 15 additional profile fields to capture learners information. The value of these fields can be changed both by learners and administrator.

### Can I customize the profile information I want to capture for each learner?

By default, learners will be asked for their first name, last name, and profile photo on sign up. As an organization, you can capture additional information at the time of login and display privacy terms and conditions for the learners. This will be useful in managing and organizing users, assigning them courses and tracking analytics.

Examples of additional information can be location, job role, language, topics of interest etc.
