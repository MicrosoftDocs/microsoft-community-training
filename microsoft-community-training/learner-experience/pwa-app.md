# Learner Experience on (PWA-based) mobile app

This article explains how learners can access training content using the [Progressive Web App (PWA) based Android mobile application](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md#option-1-creating-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-for-android) for the Community Training setup of your organization.

## Step 1: Download the app

### Option 1: Install from Play store

1. Open the Google Play Store app on your Android smartphone.

2. Search for the training app and install the application.

3. Once the app is installed, tap the app icon to launch the app.

> [!NOTE]
> Community Training enables every organization to create a custom white-labeled mobile app. Learners are provided with the name of the training app published on the Play Store by the administrator.

### Option 2: Install from the browser

1. For mobile devices (Android), you can install PWA by selecting the  **Add to home screen** prompt that you receive while browsing Community Training instance or selecting **install app** from browser options.

> The learner experience is the same for both installation options.

## Step 2: Sign in and create your profile

1. On app launch, you'll need to sign in to access the application.

Refer to [**Course Translations**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-4---create-multiple-translations-of-a-course) to understand how language change impacts your learner view.

>[!NOTE]
