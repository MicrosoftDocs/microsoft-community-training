# What's new in February 2020

We’re excited to share the new product update of Community Training (formerly Project Sangam) with you! These updates will go live on your training platform instance by the end of the week. There are some great features in this release designed to help you manage and seamlessly deliver online learning to your community.

## Shuffle questions in an exam

In this update, we have released a new setting that allows you to [**set shuffle mode**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-assessments-to-a-course.md) for exam questions when you create or update an exam. This ensures that your learners will always be offered a different version of the quiz so you can be sure that answers cannot be memorized for subsequent attempts or copied from others.

## Add audio content as a lesson for a course

Content admins can now add audio lessons (.mp3 and .ogg format) to a course. With this new improvement similar to other content types like pdf, video, etc., you can [**manage audio files**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/upload-content-to-a-course.md) as a lesson in a course.

## Add subtitles for a video lesson

Content admins can now add subtitles to videos in more than 180 languages. This additional feature is great for multilingual organizations. For [**adding subtitles**](../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-subtitles-or-captions-to-video-content.md) to your video, select the language from the drop-down menu and upload the VTT file that includes the subtitles you want to add. Subtitles must be in VTT format. To learn more about the VTT standard, please read it [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT).

### Export courses from the training instance

If you are managing multiple instances of Community Training, each catering to different target audiences but with overlapping course content -  we have made it easy for you to move content across instances in [**few simple clicks**](../../content-management/manage-content/manage-course-category/move-course-content-across-training-instance.md).

## Category filter in My Courses page

Learners can take advantage of category filters on the My Course page to quickly view enrolled courses under different course categories. Earlier, category filter functionality was available only for the Course Library view – we heard your feedback and have now made the filter available across all course views.

## Group analytics improvement

With the new release, we have made a bunch of improvements to our User Management module to enable group admins to easily monitor learner progress and course completion for their groups. Now, group admins can search for a learner in the group or track completion status for a specific course for all the group users. For more details, check out [**this article**](../../analytics/in-built-reports/group-view-report.md).
