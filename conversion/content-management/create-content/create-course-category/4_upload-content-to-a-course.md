# Upload content to a course

Lesson is a single unit of learning content in the form of Video, PDF, Word or PPT file for a course. We can have one or more lessons for a course depending upon how admin decides to structure the course. 

On the Microsoft Community Training Management Portal, there are two ways to upload content for a course. Admin can either upload content for each lesson manually or use bulk upload lesson feature to upload list of lessons at one go. 

In this article, you will learn more about how to upload content to a course on the management portal in the respective sections:

### Permissions Level

The Microsoft Community Training 
management portal provides role-based administration and depending upon the type of access level admins can perform an action on the portal. Table below shows administrative role which are allowed to upload content to a course in the portal:

| Access Level  | Upload content to a course |
| --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | Yes |
| Organization Administrator | Yes |
| Learning Path Administrator | Yes |
| Category Administrator | Yes|
| Course Administrator | Yes |
| Group Administrator | No |

## Option 1 Manually add content for each lesson in a course

> [!TIP]
>  Whenever you are performing content upload, [**scale up your platform configuration**](../../infrastructure-management/configure-your-platform-infrastructure/4_scale-up-instance-configuration) to reduce the upload and processing time for the content)

## Option 2 - Bulk Upload lessons
Similar to the [**Bulk Upload Courses**](https://microsoftindia.document360.io/docs/create-a-course#steps-for-bulk-upload-courses-to-the-portal) , administrator can use the Bulk Upload Lessons feature to save time and add multiple lessons and upload content for a course at once. 

In this topic, you will learn the simple steps to add multiple lessons for a course in the management portal.

### Prerequisite for using Bulk Upload Lessons feature

Before you start doing the bulk upload of lessons for a course, you need to make sure the content for the lessons is structured correctly and available in the required file format <!-- ([**Sample bulk upload lessons file**](../../../media/bulk-upload-sample-lessons.zip)) --> on your local machine. The steps below provide information on how to get your content ready for bulk upload lessons:

1.	Copy the content files which you want to upload as lessons for a course on your local machine.

2.	Select all the files you want to upload and compress them into a ZIP file. **Right click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder**.

3.	Ensure there are no folders and unsupported content files inside the ZIP file 

> [!NOTE]
> Practice quizzes and exams cannot be added to the course via bulk upload functionality unless [**you are exporting courses from one instance to another**](../../../content-management/manage-content/manage-course-category/6_move-course-content-across-training-instance).
> 
> The admins have to add them via [**add quiz and exam workflow**](../../../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/6_add-practice-course-and-exam).
