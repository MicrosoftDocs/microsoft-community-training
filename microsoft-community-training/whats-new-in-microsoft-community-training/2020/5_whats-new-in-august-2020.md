# What's new in August 2020
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic though has disrupted the world in a way never imagined before, has only increased the need for community skilling. To assist you in these unprecedented times, Microsoft Community Training is here with some exciting new product updates! 

These updates will go live on your training platform instance by end of the week. There are some great features in this release designed to help you manage and deliver online learning in a seamless manner to your communities.

## Localization of learner certificates on the platform 
In this release, we have added [support for admins to issue localized certificates](../../settings/5_customize-the-certificate-template) to learner’s post course completion. Organization administrators can now select their local language (default language is English) and upload customized certificate templates. The leaners will be issued certificate in the admin specified language and template.

## Service to Service Authentication
In this release, we have enabled [service to service (S2S) authentication](../../rest-api-management/3_service-to-service-authentication) to allow any external service to call Microsoft Community Training APIs without requiring any user to explicitly login to a platform instance. 

## Support for hidden and read-only profile fields
This release we have [enhanced the additional profile fields feature](../../settings/4_add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information) on the platform to support hidden and read-only fields in addition to the mandatory fields. We have also increased the number of supported profile fields to 15.

## Localization of phone authentication flow 
In this update, we have added support for localization of the Phone Authentication page (for the deployments enabled with Phone and OTP auth). Once learners select their language of choice on the platform home page, they will be directed to the phone authentication page which is localized in the selected language.

## Enhancement in smart group rule definition setup
In this release, we have enabled the profile field and field value drop downs in the ‘Automatically add users’ step of the Smart Group creation. Administrators will now be able to choose the pre-set profile fields and corresponding field values from these drop downs to create smart groups more efficiently. 

## Support for new languages on the platform  
Based on customer requirements, we keep adding support for new languages on the platform. This release we have added support for the following languages for the learners – Portuguese, Somali, Kurdish, Oriya, Lao.
