# Add subtitles or captions to video content

On the Community Training platform, you can add subtitles or captions to the video lessons for a course to make your course content more accessible and create an inclusive learning environment. The captions are used to help learners read while they watch and overcome difficulties (if any) in understanding the language of the voice over.

The subtitle or caption file is required to be in VTT format. For more information more about the VTT standard, please [**read it here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT).

In this article, you will learn how to add subtitles for a video content on the Community Training platform.
