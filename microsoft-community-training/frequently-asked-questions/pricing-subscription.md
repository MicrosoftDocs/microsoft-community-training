When a user downloads content for offline consumption there are no charges applicable to the organization’s end. However, mobile data charges are applicable for learners while downloading the content based on their ISP.

Example: Let's assume an organization named Contoso is using  Community Training to upskill their employees. Cathy an employee of Contoso uses the mobile app for consuming training content and downloading videos for offline consumption. During this process, Contoso is not charged any video streaming cost when Cathy is viewing video content downloaded on the mobile app.

### What are the fixed and variable costs on the Community Training


* **Fixed Cost** :  The monthly licensing fee for the platform. 

* **Variable Cost** : This component consists of Azure Storage, Media Services, and Content Delivery Cost services used to store actual course content and stream content on the learner's device. The cost for these services is variable and depends upon the actual usage such as the amount of content stored, minutes of video content watched, etc.
